Robert Cialdini Seven Principles of Influence and Persuasion.

1. Reciprocity: 
People feel obliged to return favors, gifts, and invitations. 
For example, offering a small gift or favor can lead 
to a sense of obligation to reciprocate

2. Scarcity: 
People are more motivated by the thought of losing something 
than by the thought of gaining something. 
Creating a sense of urgency or exclusivity can increase 
the perceived value of a product or service

3. Authority: 
People are more likely to comply with requests from recognized 
authorities or experts in a particular field. Demonstrating 
expertise and credibility can increase influence and persuasion

4. Consistency: 
Once people commit to something, they are more likely to honor 
that commitment. Obtaining small, voluntary commitments 
can lead to larger commitments in the future

5. Liking: 
People are more likely to say yes to those they know and like. 
Building rapport, finding commonalities, and being genuinely 
friendly can increase the likelihood of persuasion

6. Consensus (or social proof): 
People are more likely to take a particular action if they 
see others, especially similar others, taking that action. 
Using testimonials, reviews, and social proof can influence behavior

Unity: 
This principle was added later and emphasizes shared identity 
and belonging. Emphasizing shared identities and values 
can enhance persuasion and influence
