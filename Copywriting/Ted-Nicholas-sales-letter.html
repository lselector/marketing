Hello,
<p>Here are some tips from Ted Nicholas (he sold > $500,000,000 worth of
<br>products (mostly books, tapes, etc.)) and he is one of the best experts.&nbsp;
<br>I advise you to buy his book (Magic Words That Bring You Riches).&nbsp;
<br>Below is my short summary of his materials (in my words mostly).
<br>
<p>To be successful you need:
<br>Product
<br>Strategy
<br>Passion
<br>Energy (more water, low fat)
<br>Good mental food
<br>Take action
<p>Don't try to please everyone - narrow your focus
<br>Don't try to "find a need and fill it - instead find a WANT.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>How to write headlines that make sales soar
<p>Headline - 90% of success/failure of any ad or sales letter
<br>(also teaser copy on the envelope, title of the book, etc.)
<p>Headline:
<br>Attracts attention (like marquee does for a movie theater)
<br>Communicates the strongest benefit
<br>It answers the question: "What is it in this for me?"
<br>Sets the tone for the offer
<br>Selects a right audience
<p>To write great headlines with a marketer's style, 
<br>first identify benefits and features.
<p>Benefits - answers questions "so what, what it does for me?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use strong action verbs when writing down a benefit
<p>Feature - facts about the product that help build credibility
<p>Best way to capture the benefits is by studying the product
<br>and writing benefits on 3x5 cards in a headline style 
<br>(answering "so what" question).
<p>The obvious can often be your key to wealth.
<br>Most marketers miss isolating the obvious benefit of their product.
<p>Finding the biggest hidden benefit can be even more powerful technique
<br>than the obvious benefit.
<p>You can create headlines that do not come from examining the product
<p>Ask yourself: "If I had unlimited God-like powers and could grant my
<br>prospect the biggest benefit I can imagine, what would it be?"
<br>Never change a headline unless you improve results with a new headline.
<br>Test, test, test.&nbsp; Make A/B tests.&nbsp; Test 1 parameter at a time.
<p>The use of a photograph with a caption can sometimes improve results.
<p>Headline should not be longer than 17 words.
<p>Favorite words to be used in headlines:
<p>Announcing
<br>Secrets of
<br>New
<br>Now
<br>Amazing
<br>Facts you …
<br>Breakthrough
<br>At last
<br>Advise to
<br>The truth of
<br>Protect
<br>Life
<br>Here (is the way)
<br>Discover (your benefits)
<br>Do you (make these mistakes …)
<br>Bargains (stock market bargains, …)
<br>Yes
<br>Love
<br>Hate&nbsp; (Don't hate yourself)
<br>How much (is one good … )
<br>How would (you solve this …)
<br>This (could be the …)
<br>Only (way left for …)
<br>Sale ( … )
<br>FREE (Role-Royce)
<br>You (your, …)
<br>How to
<p>Good headline must motivate by stirring an emotion
<p>Use words which are colorful, vital and strong
<p>Use short words that create images or pictures
<p>Eliminate most adjectives and adverbs
<p>Avoid headlines that merely create curiosity.
<br>Prospect will feel deceived, will stop reading and will not order.
<p>Do not try to be catchy or cute.
<p>Other elements of good headline and ad:
<br>&nbsp; Don't capitalize all letters - use Capital and small letters
<br>&nbsp; Use quotation marks
<br>&nbsp; Use large first letter (drop letter)
<br>&nbsp; Use lots of sub-heads (sub-headlines)
<br>&nbsp; Use serif-type font
<br>&nbsp; Put a copyright sign
<br>&nbsp; Limit use of reverse printing
<br>&nbsp; Use caption under pictures and photographs
<br>&nbsp; Use name (your name)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>===================================
<br>Writing and ideal sales letter:
<br>Clarity
<br>must flow
<br>passion, appeal to emotions
<br>sales come from enthusiasm
<br>believability, specificity
<br>close the sale
<p>before writing:
<br>&nbsp; be rested
<br>&nbsp; eat sparingly
<br>&nbsp; exercise moderately
<br>&nbsp; do something you enjoy
<br>&nbsp; cut off the phone
<br>&nbsp; count your blessings every day
<br>&nbsp; prepare yourself - get into a peak emotion state
<p>Spend 50-80% of you time on your headline
<p>Prepare order card (your offer) - beautiful, filled with benefits
<p>Use a courier typeface in body copy of the letter (in print)
<p>Remove all boring parts
<p>Read your copy out loud - how it flows
<p>Put your logo at the end of the letter
<p>Good way to start - anecdote (2-3 sentence story or quotation)
<p>Every paragraph should be short.&nbsp; Use short words.
<p>Ask about each paragraph:
<br>&nbsp; Is it hot?
<br>&nbsp; Is it exciting?
<br>&nbsp; Is it important , but boring
<br>&nbsp; Is it boring
<p>Offer FREE bonuses (bonuses should be valuable by themselves)
<p>Close the sale
<p>Include a guarantee (the longer - the better)
<p>Include PS (restate and enhance offer and benefits)
<p>Make signature "reflex blue"
<p>Find good copy - and rewrite it by hand to practice
<p>Other elements of good copy:
<br>&nbsp; don't exaggerate, be believable, admit some flaws
<br>&nbsp; don't put too many graphics or different type faces
<br>&nbsp; be respectful
<br>&nbsp; include as many benefits as you can (don't cut on benefits)
<br>&nbsp; offer should be clear - don't confuse the prospect
