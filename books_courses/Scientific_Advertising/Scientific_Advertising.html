<br>Chapter One
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>How Advertising Laws Are Established
<p>The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached the status
of a science. It is based on fixed principles and is reasonably exact.
The causes and effects have been analyzed until they are well understood.
<p>The correct methods of procedure have been proved and established. We
know what is most effective, and we act on basic law.
<p>Advertising, once a gamble, has thus become, under able direction, one
of the safest business ventures.
<p>Certainly no other enterprise with comparable possibilities need involve
so little risk.
<p>Therefore, this book deals, not with theories and opinions, but with
well-proven principles and facts. It is written as a text book for students
and a safe guide for advertisers. Every statement has been weighed. The
book is confined to establish fundamentals. If we enter any realms of uncertainty
we shall carefully denote them.
<p>The present status of advertising is due to many reasons. Much national
advertising has long been handled by large organizations known as advertising
agencies. Some of these agencies, in their hundreds of campaigns, have
tested and compared thousands of plans and ideas. The results have been
watched and recorded, so no lessons have been lost. Such agencies employ
a high grade of talent. None but able and experienced men can meet the
requirements in national advertising. Working in co-operation, learning
from each other and from each new undertaking, some of these men develop
into masters.
<p>Individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas
behind them. These become a part of the organization's equipment, and a
guide to all who follow. Thus, in the course of decades, such agencies
become storehouses of advertising experiences, proved principles, and methods.
<p>The large agencies also come into intimate contact with experts in every
department of business. Their clients are usually dominating concerns.
So they see the results of countless methods and policies. They become
a clearing house for everything pertaining to merchandising. Nearly every
selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many
experiences.
<p>Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising
become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The compass of accurate
knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.
We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. This is done
through keyed advertising, by traced returns, largely by the use of coupons.
We compare one way with many others, backward and forward and record the
results. When one method invariably proves the best, that method becomes
a fixed principle.
<p>Mail order advertising is traced down to the fraction of a penny. The
cost per reply and cost per dollar of sale show up with utter exactness.
One ad is compared with another, one method with another. Headlines, settings,
sizes, arguments and pictures are compared. To reduce the cost of results
even one percent means much in some mail order advertising. So no guesswork
is permitted. One must know what is best. Thus mail order advertising first
established many of our basic laws.
<p>In lines where direct returns are impossible, we compare one town with
another. Scores of methods may be compared in this way, measured by cost
of sales.
<p>But the most common way is by the use of the coupon. We offer a sample,
a book, a free package, or something to induce direct replies. Thus we
learn the amount of action which each ad engenders.
<p>But those figures are not final. One ad may bring to many worthless
replies, another replies that are valuable. So our final conclusions are
always based on cost per customer or cost per dollar of sale.
<p>These coupon plans are dealt with further in the chapter on "Test Campaigns."
Here we explain only how we employ them to discover advertising principles.
<p>In a large agency coupon returns are watched and recorded on hundreds
of different lines. In a single line they are sometimes recorded on thousands
of separate ads. Thus we test everything pertaining to advertising. We
answer nearly every possible question by multitudinous traced returns.
<p>Some things we learn in this way apply only to particular lines. But
even those supply basic principles for analogous undertakings.
<p>Others apply to all lines. They become fundamentals for advertising
in general. They are universally applied. No wise advertiser will ever
depart from those unvarying laws.
<p>We propose in this book to deal with those fundamentals, those universal
principles. To teach only established techniques. There is that technique
in advertising, as in all art, science and mechanics. And it is, as in
all lines, a basic essential.
<p>The lack of those fundamentals has been the main trouble with advertising
of the past. Each worker was a law to himself. All previous knowledge,
all progress in the line, was a closed book to him.
<p>It was like a man trying to build a modern locomotive without first
ascertaining what others had done. It was like a Columbus starting out
to find an undiscovered land. Men were guided by whims and fancies - vagrant,
changing breezes. They rarely arrived at their port. When they did - by
accident - it was by a long roundabout course. Each early mariner in this
sea mapped his own separate course. There were no charts to guide him.
<p>Not a lighthouse marked a harbor, not a buoy showed a reef. The wrecks
were unrecorded, so countless ventures came to grief on the same rocks
and shoals.
<p>Advertising was then a gamble - a speculation of the rashest sort. One
man's guess on the proper course was as likely to be as good as another's.
There were no safe pilots, because few sailed the same course twice.
<p>The condition has been corrected. Now the only uncertainties pertain
to people and to products, not to methods. It is hard to measure human
idiosyncrasies, the preferences and prejudices, the likes and dislikes
that exist. We cannot say that an article will be popular, but we know
how to sell it in the most effective way.
<p>Ventures may fail, but the failures are not disasters. Losses, when
they occur, are but trifling. And the causes are factors which has nothing
to do with the advertising.
<p>Advertising has flourished under these new conditions. It has multiplied
in volume, in prestige and respect. The perils have increased many fold.
Just because the gamble has become a science, the speculation a very conservative
business.
<p>These facts should be recognized by all. This is no proper field for
sophistry or theory, or for any other will-'o-the-wisp. The blind leading
the blind is ridiculous. It is pitiful in a field with such vast possibilities.
<p>Success is a rarity, a maximum success an impossibility, unless one
is guided by laws as immutable as the law of gravitation.
<p>So our main purpose here is to set down those laws, and to tell you
how to prove them for yourself. After them come a myriad variations. No
two advertising campaigns are ever conducted on lines that are identical.
<p>Individuality is an essential. Imitation is a reproach. But those variable
things which depend on ingenuity have not a place in a text book on advertising.
This is for groundwork only.
<p>Our hope is to foster advertising through a better understanding. To
place it on a business basis. To have it recognized as among the safest,
surest ventures which lead to large returns. Thousands of conspicuous successes
show its possibilities. Their variety points out its almost unlimited scope.
Yet thousands who need it - who can never attain their deserts without
it - still look upon its accomplishments as somewhat accidental.
<p>That was so, but it is not so now. We hope that this book will throw some new 
  lights on the subject.

<br>Chapter Two
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Just Salesmanship
<p>To properly understand advertising or to learn even its rudiments one
must start with the right conception.
<p>Advertising is salesmanship. Its principles are the principles of salesmanship.
Successes and failures in both lines are due to like causes. Thus every
advertising question should be answered by salesman's standards.
<p>Let us emphasize that point. The only purpose of advertising is to make
sales. It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales.
It is not for general effect. It is not to keep your name before the people.
It is not primarily to aid your other salesmen.
<p>Treat it like a salesman. Force it to justify itself. Compare it to
other salesman. Figure its cost and result.
<p>Accept no excuses which good salesmen do not make. Then you will not
go far wrong.
<p>The difference is only in degree. Advertising is multiplied salesmanship.
It may appeal to thousands while the salesman talks to one. It involves
a corresponding cost. Some people spend $10 per word on an average advertisement.
Therefore every ad should be a super - salesman.
<p>A salesman's mistake may cost little. An advertisers mistake may cost
a thousand times that much. Be more cautious, more exacting, therefore.
A mediocre salesman may affect a small part of your trade. Mediocre advertising
affects all of your trade.
<p>Many think of advertising as ad-writing. Literary qualifications have
no more to do with it than oratory has with salesmanship. One must be able
to express himself briefly, clearly and convincingly, just as a salesman
must.
<p>But fine writing is a distinct disadvantage. So is unique literary style.
They take attention from the subject. They reveal the hook. Any studied
attempt to sell, if apparent, creates corresponding resistance.
<p>That is so in personal salesmanship as in salesmanship-in-print. Fine
talkers are rarely good salesman. They inspire buyers with the fear of
over-influence. They create the suspicion that an effort is made to sell
them on other lines than merit.
<p>Successful salesman are rarely good speech makers. They have few oratorical
graces. They are plain and sincere men who know their customers and know
their lines. So it is in ad-writing. Many of the ablest men in advertising
are graduate salesmen. The best we know have been house-to-house canvassers.
They may know
<p>little of grammar, nothing of rhetoric, but they know how to use words
that convince.
<p>There is one simple way to answer many advertising questions. Ask yourself,
"Would it help a salesman sell the goods?" "Would it help me sell them
if I met a buyer in person?" A fair answer to those questions avoids the
countless mistakes. But when one tries to show off, or does things merely
to please himself, he is little likely to strike a chord which leads people
to spend money.
<p>Some argue for slogans, some like clever conceits. Would you use them
in personal salesmanship? Can you imagine a customer whom such things would
impress? If not, don't rely on them for selling in print.
<p>Some say "Be very brief. People will read for little." Would you say
that to a salesman? With a prospect standing before him, would you confine
him to any certain number of words? That would be an unthinkable handicap.
<p>So in advertising. The only readers we get are people whom our subject
interests. No one reads ads for amusement, long or short. Consider them
as prospects standing before you, seeking for information. Give them enough
to get action.
<p>Some advocate large type and big headlines. Yet they do not admire salesman
who talk in loud voices. People read all they care to read in 8-point type.
Our magazines and newspapers are printed in that type. Folks are accustomed
to it. Anything larger is like loud conversation. It gains no attention
worthwhile. It may not be offensive, but it is useless and wasteful. It
multiplies the cost of your story. And to many it seems loud and blatant.
<p>Others look for something queer and unusual. They want ads distinctive
in style or illustration. Would you want that in a salesman? Do not men
who act and dress in normal ways make a far better impression?
<p>Some insist on dressy ads. That is all right to a certain degree, but
it is quite important. Some poorly-dressed men, prove to be excellent salesmen.
Overdress in either is a fault.
<p>So with countless questions. Measure them by salesmen's standards, not
by amusement standards. Ads are not written to entertain. When they do,
those entertainment seekers are little likely to be the people whom you
want. That is one of the greatest advertising faults. Ad writers abandon
their parts. They forget they are salesmen and try to be performers. Instead
of sales, they seek applause.
<p>When you plan or prepare an advertisement, keep before you a typical
buyer. Your subject, your headline has gained his or her attention. Then
in everything be guided by what you would do if you met the buyer face-to-face.
<p>If you are a normal man and a good salesman you will then do your level
best.
<p>Don't think of the people in the mass. That gives you a blurred view.
Think of a typical individual, man or women who is likely to want what
you sell. Don't try to be amusing. Money spending is a serious matter.
Don't boast, for all people resent it. Don't try to show off. Do just what
you think a good salesman should do with a half-sold person before him.
<p>Some advertising men go out in person and sell before they plan to write
an ad. One of the ablest of men has spent weeks on one article, selling
from house to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different
forms of argument an approach. They learn what possible buyers want and
the factors which don't appeal. It is quite customary to interview hundreds
of possible customers.
<p>Others send out questionnaires to learn the attitude of the buyers.
In some way all must learn how to strike responsive chords. Guesswork is
very expensive.
<p>The maker of an advertised article knows the manufacturing side and
probably the dealer's side. But the very knowledge often leads him astray
in respect to customers. His interests are not in their interests. The
advertising man studies the consumer. He tries to place himself in the
position of the buyer. His success largely depends on doing that to the
exclusion of everything else.
<p>This book will contain no more important chapter than this one on salesmanship.
The reason for most of the non-successes in advertising is trying to sell
people what they do not want. But next to that comes lack of true salesmanship.
<p>Ads are planned and written with some utterly wrong conception. They are written 
  to please the seller. The interest of the buyer are forgotten. One can never 
  sell goods profitable, in person or in print, when that attitude exists.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Three
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Offer Service
<p>Remember the people you address are selfish, as we all are. They care
nothing about your interests or your profit. They seek service for themselves.
Ignoring this fact is a common mistake and a costly mistake in advertising.
Ads say in effect, "Buy my brand. Give me the trade you give to others.
Let me have the money."
<p>That is not a popular appeal.
<p>The best ads ask no one to buy. That is useless. Often they do not quote
a price. They do not say that dealers handle the product.
<p>The ads are based entirely on service. They offer wanted information.
They site advantages to users. Perhaps they offer a sample, or to buy the
first package, or to send something on approval, so the customer may prove
the claims without any cost or risks. Some of these ads seem altruistic.
But they are based on the knowledge of human nature. The writers know how
people are led to buy.
<p>Here again is salesmanship. The good salesman does not merely cry a
name. He doesn't say, "Buy my article."
<p>He pictures the customer's side of his service until the natural result
is to buy.
<p>A brush maker has some 2,000 canvassers who sells brushes from house
to house. He is enormously successful in a line which would seem very difficult.
And it would be for his men asked the housewives to buy.
<p>But they don't. They go to the door and say, "I was sent here to give
you a brush. I have samples here and I want you to take your choice." The
housewife is all smiles and attention. In picking out one brush she sees
several she wants. She is also anxious to reciprocate the gift. So the
salesman gets an order.
<p>Another concern sells coffee, etc., by wagons in some 500 cities. The
man drops in with a half-pound of coffee
<p>and says, "Accept this package and try it. I'll come back in a few days
to ask you how you liked it."
<p>Even when he comes back he doesn't ask for an order. He explains that
he wants to send the women a fine kitchen utensil. It isn't free, but if
she likes the coffee he will credit five cents on each pound she buys until
shehas paid for the article. Always some service.
<p>The maker of the electric sewing machine motor found advertising difficult.
So, on good advice, he ceased soliciting a purchase. He offered to send
to any home, through any dealer, a motor for one week's use. With it would
come a man to show how to operate. "Let us help you for one week without
cost or obligation," said the ad. Such an offer was resistless, and about
nine in ten of the trials led to sales.
<p>So in many, many lines. Cigar makers send out boxes to anyone and say,
"Smoke ten, and then keep them or return them, as you wish."
<p>Makers of books, typewriters, washing machines, kitchen cabinets, vacuum
sweepers, etc., send out their
<p>products without any prepayment. They say, "Use them, then do as you
wish." Practically all merchandise sold by mail is sent subject to return.
<p>These are all common principles of salesmanship. The most ignorant peddler
applies them. Yet th salesman-in-print very often forgets them. He talks
about his interest. He blazons a name, as though that was of importance.
His phrase is "Drive people to the stores," and that is his attitude in
everything he says.
<p>People can be coaxed but not driven. Whatever they do they do to please
themselves. Many fewer mistakes would be made in advertising if these facts
were never forgotten.

<br>Chapter Four
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Mail Order Advertising - What It Teaches
<p>The severest test of an advertising man is in selling goods by mail.
But that is a school from which he must
<p>graduate before he can hope for success. There cost and result are immediately
apparent. False theories melt
<p>away like snowflakes in the sun. The advertising is profitable or it
is not, clearly on the face of the returns.
<p>Figures which do not lie tell at once the merits of an ad.
<p>This puts men on their mettle. All guesswork is eliminated. Every mistake
is conspicuous. One quickly loses this conceit by learning how often his
judgment errs - often nine times in ten. There one learns that advertising
must be done on a scientific basis to have any fair chance of success.
And he learns that every wasted dollar adds to the cost of results.
<p>Here he is taught tough efficiency and economy under a master who can't
be fooled. Then, and only then, is he apt to apply the same principles
and keys to all advertising.
<p>A man was selling a $5 article. The replies from his ad cost him 85
cents. Another man submitted an ad which he thought better. The replies
cost him $14.20 each. Another man submitted an ad which for two years brought
replies at an average of 41 cents each.
<p>Consider the difference, on 250,000 replies per year. Think how valuable
was the man who cut the cost in two.
<p>Think what it would have meant to continue that $14.20 ad without any
key on returns.
<p>Yet there are thousands of advertisers who do just that. They spend
large sums on a guess. And they are doing what that man did - paying for
sales from 2 to 35 times what they need cost.
<p>A study of mail order advertising reveals many things worth learning.
It is a prime subject for study. In the first place, if continued, you
know that pays. It is therefore good advertising as applied to that line.
<p>The probability is that the ad has resulted from many traced comparisons.
It is therefore the best advertising, not theoretical. It will not deceive
you. The lessons it teaches are principles which wise men apply to all
advertising.
<p>Mail order advertising is always set in small type. It is usually set
in smaller type than ordinary print. The economy of space is universal.
So it proves conclusively that larger type does not pay. Remember that
when you double your space by doubling the size of your type. The ad may
still be profitable. But traced returns have proved that you are paying
a double price for sales.
<p>In mail order advertising there is no waste of space. Every line is
utilized. Borders are rarely used. Remember that when you are tempted to
leave valuable space unoccupied.
<p>In mail order advertising there is no jargon. There is no boasting,
save of super-service. There is no useless talk.
<p>There is no attempt at entertainment. There is nothing to amuse.
<p>Mail order advertising usually contains a coupon. That is there to cut
out as a reminder of something the reader has decided to do. Mail order
advertisers know that readers forget. They are reading a magazine of interest.
The may be absorbed in a story. A large percentage of people who read an
ad and decide to act will forget that decision in five minutes. The mail
order advertisers that waste by tests, and he does not propose to accept
it.
<p>So he inserts that reminder to be cut out, and it turns when the reader
is ready to act.
<p>In mail order advertising the pictures are always put to the point.
They are salesmen in themselves. They earn space they occupy. The size
is guaged by their importance. The picture of a dress one is trying to
sell may occupy much space. Less important things get smaller spaces.
<p>Pictures in ordinary advertising may teach little. They probably result
in whims. But pictures in mail order advertising may form half the cost
of selling. And you may be sure that everything about them has been decided
by comparative tests. Before you use useless pictures, merely to decorate
or interest, look over some mail order ads. Mark what their verdict is.
<p>A man advertised an incubator to be sold by mail. Type ads with right
headlines brought excellent returns. But he conceived the idea that a striking
picture would increase those returns. So he increased his space by 50 per
cent to add a row of chickens in silhouette.
<p>It did make a striking ad, but his cost per reply was increased by exactly
that 50 per cent. The new ad, costing one-half more for every insertion,
brought not one added sale.
<p>The man learned that incubator buyers were practical people. They were
looking for attractive offers, not pictures.
<p>Think of the countless untraced campaigns where a whim of that kind
costs half the advertising money without a penny in return. And it may
go on year after year.
<p>Mail order advertising tells a complete story if the purpose is to make
an immediate sale. You see no limitations there on amount of copy. The
motto there is, "The more you tell the more you sell." And it has never
failed to prove out so in any test we know.
<p>Sometimes the advertiser uses small ads, sometime large ads. None are
too small to tell a reasonable story.
<p>But an ad twice larger brings twice the returns. A four-times-larger
ad brings four times the returns, and usually some in addition.
<p>But this occurs only when the larger space is utilized as well as the
small space. Set half-page copy in a page space and you double the cost
in returns. We have seen many a test prove that.
<p>Look at an ad of the Mead Cycle Company - a typical mail order ad. These
have been running for many years.
<p>The ads are unchanging. Mr. Mead told the writer that not for $10,000
would he change a single ad in his words.
<p>For many years he compared one ad with the other. And the ads you see
today are the final results of all those experiments. Note the picture
he uses, the headlines, the economy of space, the small type. Those ads
are as near perfect for their purpose as an ad can be.
<p>So with any other mail order ad which has long continued. Every feature,
every word and picture teaches advertising at its best. You may not like
them. You may say they are unattractive, crowded, hard to read -anything
you will. But the test results has proved those ads the best salesman those
lines have yet discovered.
<p>And they certainly pay.
<p>Mail order advertising is the court of last resort. You may get the
same instruction, if you will, by keying other ads. But mail order ads
are models. They are selling goods profitably in a difficult way. It is
far harder to get mail orders than to send buyers to the stores. It is
hard to sell goods which can't be seen. Ads which do that are excellent
examples of what advertising should be.
<p>We cannot often follow all the principle of mail order advertising,
though we know we should. The advertiser forces a compromise. Perhaps pride
in our ads has an influence. But every departure from those principles
adds to our selling cost. Therefore it is always a question of what we
are willing to pay for our frivolities.
<p>We can at least know what we pay. We can make keyed comparisons, and
one ad with another. Whenever we do we invariably find that the nearer
we get to proved mail order copy the more customers we get for our money.
<p>This is another important chapter. Think it over. What real difference
is there between inducing a customer to order by mail or order from his
dealer? Why should the methods of salesmanship differ?
<p>They should not. When they do, it is for one of two reasons. Either
the advertiser does not know what the mail order advertiser knows. He is
advertising blindly. Or he is deliberately sacrificing a percentage of
his returns to gratify some desire.
<p>There is some apology for that, just as there is for fine offices and
buildings. Most of us can afford to do something for pride and opinion.
But let us know what we are doing. Let us know the cost of our pride. Then,
if our advertising fails to bring us the wanted returns, let us go back
to our model - a good mail order ad - and eliminate some of our waste.

----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Five
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Headlines
<p>The difference between advertising and personal salesmanship lies largely
in personal contact. The salesman
<p>is there to demand attention. He cannot be ignored. The advertisement
can be ignored.
<p>But the salesman wastes too much of his time on prospects whom he can
never hope to interest. He cannot
<p>pick them out. The advertisement is read only by interested people who,
by their own volition, study what we
<p>have to say.
<p>The purpose of headline is to pick out people you can interest. You
wish to talk to someone in a crowd. So the
<p>first thing you say is, "Hey there, Bill Jones" to get the right persons
attention.
<p>So in an advertisement. What you have will interest certain people only,
and for certain reasons. You care only
<p>for those people. Then create a headline which will hail those people
only.
<p>Perhaps a blind headline or some clever conceit will attract many times
as many. But they may consist of
<p>mostly impossible subjects for what you have to offer. And the people
you are after may never realize that the ad
<p>refers to something they may want.
<p>Headlines on ads are like headlines on news items. Nobody reads a whole
newspaper. One is interested in
<p>financial news, one in political, one in society, one in cookery, one
in sports, etc. There are whole pages in any
<p>newspaper which we may never scan at all. Yet other people might turn
directly to those pages. We pick out
<p>what we wish to read by headlines, and we don't want those headlines
misleading. The writing of headlines is
<p>one of the greatest journalistic arts. They either conceal or reveal
an interest.
<p>Suppose a newspaper article states that a certain women was the most
beautiful in the city. That article would
<p>be of interest to that woman and her friends. But neither she nor her
friends would ever read it if the headline was
<p>"Egyptian Psychology."
<p>So in advertising. It is commonly said that people do not read advertisements.
That is silly, of course. We who
<p>spend millions in advertising and watch the returns marvel at the readers
we get. Again and again we see 20 per
<p>cent of all the readers of a newspaper cut out a certain coupon.
<p>But people do not read ads for amusement. They don't read ads which,
at a glance, seem to offer nothing
<p>interesting. A double-page ad on a women's dress will not gain a glance
from a man. Nor will a shaving cream ad
<p>from a woman.
<p>Always bear these facts in mind. People are hurried. The average person
worth cultivating has too much to
<p>read. They skip three fourths of the reading matter which they pay to
get. They are not going to read your
<p>business talk unless you make it worth their while and let the headline
show it.
<p>People will not be bored in print. They may listen politely at a dinner
table to boasts and personalities, life
<p>history, etc. But in print they choose their own companions, their own
subjects. They want to be amused or
<p>benefited. They want economy, beauty, labor saving, good things to eat
and wear. There may be products which
<p>interest them more than anything else in the magazine. But they will
never know it unless the headline or
<p>picture tells them.
<p>The writer of this chapter spends far more time on headlines than on
writing. He often spends hours on a single
<p>headline. Often scores of headlines are discarded before the right one
is selected. For the entire return from an ad depends on attracting the
right sort of readers. The best of salesmanship has no chance whatsoever
unless we get a hearing.
<p>The vast difference in headlines is shown by keyed returns which this
book advocates. The identical ad run with various headlines differs tremendously
in its returns. It is not uncommon for a change in headlines to multiply
returns from five or ten times over. So we compare headlines until we know
what sort of appeal pays best. That differs in every line, of course.
<p>The writer has before him keyed returns on nearly two thousand headlines
used on a single product. The story in these ads are nearly identical.
But the returns vary enormously, due to the headlines. So with every keyed
return in our record appears the headlines that we used.
<p>Thus we learn what type of headline has the most wide-spread appeal.
The product has many uses. It fosters beauty. It prevents disease. It aides
daintiness and cleanliness. We learn to exactness which quality most of
our readers seek.
<p>That does not mean we neglect the others. One sort of appeal may bring
half the returns of another, yet be important enough to be profitable.
We overlook no field that pays. But we know what proportion of our ads
should, in the headline, attract any certain class.
<p>For this same reason we employ a vast variety of ads. If we are using
twenty magazines we may use twenty separate ads. This because circulation's
overlap, and because a considerable percentage of people are attracted
by each of several forms of approach. We wish to reach them all.
<p>On a soap, for instance, the headline "Keep Clean" might attract a very
small percentage. It is to commonplace.
<p>So might the headline, "No Animal Fat." People may not care much about
that. The headline, "It Floats" might prove interesting. But a headline
referring to beauty or complexion might attract many times as many.
<p>An automobile ad might refer in the headline to a good universal joint.
It might fall flat, because so few buyers think of universal joints. The
same ad with a headline, "The Sportiest Of Sport Bodies," might out-pull
the other fifty to one. This is enough to suggest the importance of headlines.
Anyone who keys ads will be amazed at the difference. The appeals we like
best will rarely prove best, because we do not know enough people to average
up their desires. So we learn on each line by experiment.
<p>But back of all lie fixed principles. You are presenting an ad to millions.
Among them is a percentage, small or large, whom you hope to interest.
Go after that percentage and try to strike the chord that responds. If
you are advertising corsets, men and children don't interest you. If you
are advertising cigars, you have no use for non-smokers. Razors won't attract
women, rouge will not interest men.
<p>Don't think that those millions will read your ads to find out if your product 
  interests them. They will decide by a glance - by your headline or pictures. 
  Address the people you seek, and them only.

<br>Chapter Six
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Psychology
<p>The competent advertising man must understand psychology. The more he
knows about if the better. He must
<p>learn that certain effects lead to certain reactions, and use that knowledge
to increase results and avoid
<p>mistakes.
<p>Human nature is perpetual. In most respects it is the same today as
in the time of Caesar. So the principles of
<p>psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to unlearn what
you learn about them.
<p>We learn, for instance, that curiosity is one of the strongest human
incentives. We employ it when ever we can.
<p>Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice were made successful largely through curiosity.
"Grains Puffed To 8 Times The Normal Size." "Foods Shot From Guns." "125
Millions Steam Explosions Caused In Every Kernel." These foods were failures
before that factor was discovered.
<p>We learn that cheapness is not a strong appeal. Americans are extravagant.
They want bargains but not cheapness. They want to feel that they can afford
to eat and have and wear the best. Treat them as if they could not and
they resent your attitude.
<p>We learn that people judge largely by price. They are not experts. In
the British National Gallery is a painting which is announced in a catalog
to have cost $750,000. Most people at first pass it by at a glance. Then
later they get farther on in the catalog and learn what the painting cost.
They return then and surround it.
<p>A department store advertised at one Easter time a $1,000 hat, and the
floor could not hold the women who came to see it.
<p>We often employ this factor in psychology. Perhaps we are advertising
a valuable formula. To merely say that would not be impressive. So we state
- as a fact - that we paid $100,000 for that formula. That statement when
tried has won a wealth of respect.
<p>Many articles are sold under guarantee - so commonly sold that guarantees
have ceased to be impressive. But one concern made a fortune by offering
a dealer's signed warrant. The dealer to whom one paid his money
<p>agreed in writing to pay it back if asked. Instead of a far-away stranger,
a neighbor gave the warrant. The results have led to many to try that plan,
and it has always proved effective.
<p>Many have advertised, "Try it for a week. If you don't like it we'll
return your money." Then someone convinced the idea of sending goods without
any money down, and saying "Pay in a week if you like them." That proved
many times impressive.
<p>One great advertising man stated the difference this way: "Two men came
to me, each offering me a horse.
<p>Both made equal claims. They were good horses, kind and gentle. A child
could drive them. One man said, ' Try the horse for a week. If my claims
are not true, come back for your money.' The other man also said, ' Try
the horse for a week.' But he added, 'Come and pay me then.' I naturally
bought the second man's horse."
<p>Now countless things - cigars, typewriters, washing machines, books,
etc. - are sent out in this way on approval. And we find that people are
honest. The losses are very small.
<p>An advertiser offered a set of books to business men. The advertising
was unprofitable, so he consulted another expert. The ads were impressive.
The offer seemed attractive. "But," said the second man, "let us add one
little touch which I have found effective. Let us offer to put the buyer's
name in gilt lettering on each book." That was done, and with scarcely
another change in the ads they sold some hundred of thousands of books.
<p>Through some peculiar kink in human psychology that names in gilt gave
much added value to the books.
<p>Many send out small gifts, like memorandum books, to customers and prospects.
They get very small results.
<p>One man sent out a letter to the effect that he had a leather-covered
book with a man's name on it. It was waiting on him and would be sent on
request. The form of request was enclosed, and it also asked for certain
information. That information indicated lines on which a man might be sold.
<p>Nearly all men, it was found, filled out that request and supplied the
information. When a man knows something belongs to them - something with
his name on - he will make an effort to get it, even though the thing is
a trifle.
<p>In the same way it is found that an offer is limited to a certain class
of people is far more effective than a general offer. For instance, an
offer limited to veterans of the war. Or to members of a lodge or sect.
Or to executives.
<p>Those who are entitled to any seeming advantage will go a long way not
to lose that advantage.
<p>An advertiser suffered much from substitution. He said, "Look out for
substitutes," "Be sure you get this brand," etc., with no effect. Those
were selfish appeals. Then he said, "Try our rivals' too" - said it in
his headlines. He invited comparisons and showed that he did not fear them.
That corrected the situation. Buyers were careful to get the brand so conspicuously
superior that its maker could court a trial of the rest.
<p>Two advertisers offered food products nearly identical. Both offered
a full-size package. A coupon was good at any store for a package, for
which the maker paid retail price.
<p>The first advertiser failed and the second succeeded. The first even
lost a large part of the trade he had. He cheapened his product by giving
a 15-cent package away. It is hard to pay for an article which has once
been free. It is like paying railroad fare after traveling on a pass.
<p>The other gained added respect for his article by paying retail price
to let the user try it. An article good enough for the maker to buy is
good enough for the user to buy. It is vastly different to pay 15 cents
to let you try an article than to simply say "It's free."
<p>So with sampling. Hand an unwanted product to a housewife and she pays
it slight respect. She is in no mood to see its virtues. But get her to
ask for a sample after reading your story, and she is in a very different
position.
<p>She knows your claims. She is interested in them, else she would not
act. And she expects to find the qualities you told.
<p>There is a great deal in mental impression. Submit five articles exactly
alike and five people may choose one of them. But point out in one some
qualities to notice and everyone will find them. The five people then will
all choose the same article.
<p>If people can be made sick or well by mental impressions, they can be
made to favor a certain brand in that way. And that, on some lines, is
the only way to win them.
<p>Two concerns, side by side, sold women's clothing on installments. The
appeal, of course, was to poor girls who desire to dress better. One treated
them like poor girls and made the bare business offer.
<p>The other put a woman in charge - a motherly, dignified, capable woman.
They did business in her name. They used her picture. She signed all ads
and letters. She wrote to these girls like a friend. She knew herself what
it meant to a girl not to be able to dress her best. She had long sought
a chance to supply women good clothes and give them all season to pay.
Now she was able to do so, with the aid of men behind her.
<p>There was no comparison in those two appeals. It was not long before
this woman's long - established next-door rival had to quit.
<p>The backers of this business sold house furnishings on installments.
Sending out catalogs promiscuously did not pay. Offering long-time credit
often seems like a reflection.
<p>But when a married woman bought garments from Mrs. _____, and paid as
agreed, they wrote to her something like this: "Mrs. _____, whom we know,
tells us that you are one of her good customers. She has dealt with you,
she says, and you do just as you agree. So we have opened with you a credit
account on our books, good anytime you wish. When you want anything in
furnishings, just order it. Pay nothing in advance. WE are glad to send
it without any investigation to a person recommended as you are."
<p>That was flattering. Naturally those people, when they wanted some furniture,
would order from that house.
<p>There are endless phases to psychology. Some people know them by instinct.
Many of them are taught by experience. But we learn most of them from others.
When we see a winning method we note it down for use when occasion offers.
<p>These things are very important. An identical offer made in a different
way may bring multiplied returns.
<p>Somewhere in the mines of business experience we must find the best method 
  somehow.

<br>Chapter Seven
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Being Specific
<p>Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water
from a duck. They leave no impression whatever. To say, "Best in the world,"
"Lowest price in existence," etc. are at best simply claiming the expected.
But superlatives of that sort are usually damaging. They suggest looseness
of expression, a tendency to exaggerate, a careless truth. They lead readers
to discount all the statements that you make.
<p>People recognize a certain license in selling talk as they do poetry.
A man may say, "Supreme in quality" without seeming a liar, though one
may know that the other brands are equally as good. One expects a salesman
to put his best foot forward and excuses some exaggeration born of enthusiasm.
But just for that reason general statements count for little. And a man
inclined to superlatives must expect that his every statement will be taken
with some caution.
<p>But a man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or
a lie. People do not expect an advertiser to lie. They know that he can't
lie in the best mediums. The growing respect in advertising has largely
come through a growing regard for its truth. So a definite statement is
usually accepted. Actual figures are notgenerally discounted. Specific
facts, when stated, have their full weight and effect.
<p>This is very important to consider in written or personal salesmanship.
The weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making it specific.
Say that a tungsten lamp gives more light than a carbon and you leave some
doubt. Say it gives three and one-third times the light and people realize
that you have made tests and comparisons.
<p>A dealer may say, "Our prices have been reduced" without creating any
marked impression. But when he says, "Our prices have been reduced 25 per
cent" he gets the full value of his announcement.
<p>A mail order advertiser sold women's clothing to people of the poorer
classes. For years he used the slogan, "Lowest prices in America." His
rivals all copied that. Then he guaranteed to undersell any other dealer.
His rivals did likewise. Soon those claims became commonplace to every
advertiser in his line, and they became commonplace.
<p>Then under able advice, he changed his statement to "Our net profit
is 3%." That was a definite statement and it proved very impressive. With
their volumes of business it was evident that their prices must be minimum.
No one could be expected to do business on less than 3 percent. The next
year their business made a sensational increase.
<p>At one time in the automobile business there was a general impression
that profits were excessive. One well-advised advertiser came out with
a statement, "Our profit is 9 per cent." Then he cited actual costs on
the hidden costs of a $1,500 car. They amounted to $735, without including
anything one could easily see. This advertiser made a great success along
those lines at that time.
<p>Shaving soaps have long been advertised "Abundant lather," "Does not
dry on face," "Acts quickly," etc. One advertiser had as good a chance
as the other to impress those claims. Then a new make came into the field.
It was a tremendously difficult field, for every customer had to be taken
from someone else. He stated specific facts. He said, "Softens the beard
in one minute," and "Maintains its creamy fullness for ten minutes on the
face." "The final result of testing and comparing 130 formulas." Perhaps
never in advertising has there been a quicker and greater response in an
equally difficult field.
<p>Makers of safety razors have long advertised quick shaves. One make
advertised a 78-second shave. That was definite. It indicated actual tests.
That man at once made a sensational advance in his sales.
<p>In the old days all beers were advertised as "Pure." The claim made
no impression. The bigger the type used, the bigger the folly. After millions
had been spent to impress a platitude, one brewer pictured a plate glass
where beer was cooled in filtered air. He pictured a filter of white wood
pulp through which every drop was cleared. He told how bottles were washed
four times by machinery. How he went down 4,000 feet for pure water.
<p>How 1,018 experiments had been made to attain a yeast to give beer that
matchless flavor. And how all the yeast was forever made from that adopted
mother cell.
<p>All claims were such as any brewer might have made. They were mere essentials
in ordinary brewing. But he was the first to tell the people about them,
while others cried merely "pure beer." He made the greatest success that
was ever made in beer advertising. "Used the world over" is a very elastic
claim. Then one advertiser said, "Used by the peoples of 52 nations," and
many others followed.
<p>One statement may take as much room as another, yet a definite statement
be many times as effective. The difference is vast. If a claim is worth
making, make it in the most impressive way.
<p>All these effects must be studied. Salesmanship-in-print is very expensive. 
  A salesman's loose talk matters little. But when you are talking to millions 
  at enormous cost, the weight of your claims is important. No generality has 
  any weight whatever. It is like saying, "How do you do?", when you have no intention 
  of inquiring about one's health. But specific claims when made in print are 
  taken at their value. 
<p><a NAME="ch8"></a> 
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Eight
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Tell Your Full Story
<p>Whatever claim you use to gain attention, the advertisement should tell
a story reasonably complete. If you
<p>watch returns, you will find that certain claims appeal far more than
others. But in usual lines a number of
<p>claims appeal to a large percentage. Then present those claims in every
ad for their effect on that percentage.
<p>Some advertisers, for sake of brevity, present one claim at a time.
Or they write a serial ad, continued in another
<p>issue. There is no greater folly. Those serials almost never connect.
<p>When you once get a persons attention, then is the time to accomplish
all you can ever hope with him. Bring all
<p>your good arguments to bear. Cover every phase of your subject. One
fact appeals to some, one to another.
<p>Omit any one and a certain percentage will lose the fact which might
convince.
<p>People are not apt to read successive advertisements on any single line.
No more than you read a news item
<p>twice, or a story. In one reading of an advertisement one decides for
or against a proposition. And that operates
<p>against a second reading. So present to the reader, when once you get
him, every important claim you have.
<p>The best advertisers do that. They learn their appealing claims by tests
- by comparing results from various
<p>headlines. Gradually they accumulate a list of claims important enough
to use. All those claims appear in every
<p>ad thereafter.
<p>The advertisements seem monotonous to the men who read them all. A complete
story is always the same.
<p>But one must consider that the average reader is only once a reader,
probably. And what you fail to tell him in
<p>that ad is something he may never know.
<p>Some advertisers go so far as to never change their ads. Single mail
order ads often run year after year without
<p>diminishing returns. So with some general ads. They are perfected ads,
embodying in the best way known all
<p>that one has to say. Advertisers do not expect a second reading. Their
constant returns come from getting new readers.
<p>In every ad consider only new customers. People using your product are
not going to read your ads. They have already read and decided. You might
advertise month after month to present users that the product they use
is poison, and they would never know it. So never waste one line of your
space to say something to present users, unless you can say it in your
headlines. Bear in mind always that you can address an unconverted prospect.
<p>Any reader of your ad is interested, else he would not be a reader.
You are dealing with someone willing to listen. Then do your level best.
That reader, if you lose him now, may never again be a reader.
<p>You are like a salesman in a busy mans office. He may have tried again
and again to get entree. He may never be admitted again. This is his one
chance to get action, and he must employ it to the full.
<p>This brings up the question of brevity. The most common expression you
hear about advertising is that people will not read much. Yet a vast amount
of the best paying advertising shows that people do read much. Then they
write for a book, perhaps - for added information.
<p>There is a fixed rule on this subject of brevity. One sentence may tell
a complete story on a line like chewing gum. It may on an article like
Cream of Wheat. But, whether long or short, an advertising story should
be reasonably complete.
<p>A certain man desired a personal car. He cared little about the price.
He wanted a car to take pride in, else he felt he would never drive it.
But, being a good business man, he wanted value for his money.
<p>His inclination was towards a Rolls-Royce. He also considered a Pierce-Arrow,
a Locomobile and others. But these famous cars offered no information.
Their advertisements were very short. Evidently the makers considered it
undignified to argue comparative merits.
<p>The Marmon, on the contrary, told a complete story. He read columns
and books about it. So he bought a Marmon, and was never sorry. But he
afterwards learned facts about another car at nearly three times the price
which would have sold him the car had he known them.
<p>What folly it is to cry a name in a line like that, plus a few brief
generalities. A car may be a lifetime investment.
<p>It involves an important expenditure. A man interested enough to buy
a car will read a volume about it if the volume is interesting.
<p>So with everything. You may be simply trying to change a woman from
one breakfast food to another, one tooth paste, or one soap. She is wedded
to what she is using. Perhaps she has used it for years.
<p>You have a hard proposition. If you do not believe it, go to her in
person and try to make the change. Not to merely buy a first package to
please you, but to adopt your brand. A man who once does that at a woman's
door won't argue for brief advertisements. He will never again say, "A
sentence will do," or a name claim or a boast.
<p>Nor will the man who traces his results. Note that brief ads are never
keyed. Note that every traced ad tells a complete story, though it takes
columns to tell.
<p>Never be guided in any way by ads which are untraced. Never do anything because 
  some uninformed advertiser considers that something right. Never be led in new 
  paths by the blind. Apply to your advertising ordinary common sense. Take the 
  opinion of nobody, whom know nothing about his returns.

<br>Chapter Nine
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Art In Advertising
<p>Pictures in advertising are very expensive. Not in cost of good art
work alone, but in the cost of space. From one-third to one-half of an
advertising campaign is often staked on the power of the pictures.
<p>Anything expensive must be effective, else it involves much waste. So
art in advertising is a study of paramount importance.
<p>Pictures should not be used merely because they are interesting. Or
to attract attention. Or to decorate an ad.
<p>We have covered these points elsewhere. Ads are not written to interest,
please or amuse. You are not writing to please the hoi-polloi. You are
writing on a serious subject - the subject of money spending. And you address
a restricted minority.
<p>Use pictures only to attract those who may profit you. Use them only
when they form a better selling argument than the same amount of space
set in type.
<p>Mail order advertisers, as we have said, have pictures down to a science.
Some use large pictures, some small, some omit pictures entirely. A noticeable
fact is that none of them uses expensive artwork. Be sure that all these
things are done for reasons made apparent by results.
<p>Any other advertiser should apply the same principles. Or, if none exist
to apply to his line, he should work out his own by tests. It is certainly
unwise to spend large sums on a dubious adventure.
<p>Pictures in many lines form a major factor. Omitting the lines where
the article itself should be pictured. In some lines, like Arrow Collars
and most in clothing advertising, pictures have proved most convincing.
Not only in picturing the collar or the clothes, but in picturing men whom
others envy, in surroundings which others covet.
<p>The pictures subtly suggest that these articles of apparel will aid
men to those desired positions.
<p>So with correspondence schools. Theirs is traced advertising. Picturing
men in high positions of taking upward steps forms a very convincing argument.
<p>So with beauty articles. Picturing beautiful women, admired and attractive,
is a supreme inducement. But there is a great advantage in including a
fascinated man. Women desire beauty largely because of men. Then show them
using their beauty, as women do use it, to gain maximum effect.
<p>Advertising pictures should not be eccentric. Don't treat your subject
lightly. Don't lessen respect for your self or your article by any attempt
at frivolity. People do not patronize a clown. There are two things about
which men should not joke. One is business, one is home.
<p>An eccentric picture may do you serious damage. One may gain attention
by wearing a fools cap. But he would ruin his selling prospects.
<p>Then a picture which is eccentric or unique takes attention from your
subject. You cannot afford to do that.
<p>Your main appeal lies in headline. Over-shadow that and you kill it.
Don't, to gain general and useless attention, sacrifice the attention that
you want.
<p>Don't be like a salesman who wears conspicuous clothes. The small percentage
he appeals to are not usually good buyers. The great majority of the sane
and thrifty heartily despise him. Be normal in everything you do when you
are seeking confidence and conviction.
<p>Generalities cannot be applied to art. There are seeming exceptions
to most statements. Each line must be studied by itself.
<p>But the picture must help sell the goods. It should help more than anything
else could do in like space, else use that something else.
<p>Many pictures tell a story better than type can do. In advertising of
Puffed Grains the picture of the grains were found to be most effective.
They awake curiosity. No figure drawing in that case compares in results
with these grains.
<p>Other pictures form a total loss. We have cited cases of that kind.
The only way to know, as is with most other questions, is by compared results.
<p>There are disputed questions in art work which we will cite without
expressing opinions. They seem to be answered both ways, according to the
line which is advertised.
<p>Does it pay better to use fine art work or ordinary? Some advertisers
pay up to $2,000 per drawing. They figure that the space is expensive.
The art cost is small in comparison. So they consider the best worth its
cost.
<p>Others argue that few people have art education. They bring out their
ideas, and bring them out well, at a fraction of the cost. Mail order advertisers
are generally in this class.
<p>The question is one of small moment. Certainly good art pays as well
as mediocre. And the cost of preparing ads is very small compared with
the cost of insertion.
<p>Should every ad have a new picture? Or may a picture be repeated? Both
viewpoints have many supporters. The probability is that repetition is
an economy. We are after new customers always. It is not probably that
they remember a picture we have used before. If they do, repetition does
not detract.
<p>Do color pictures pay better than black and white? Not generally, according
to the evidence we have gathered to date. Yet there are exceptions. Certain
food dishes look far better in colors. Tests on lines like oranges, desserts,
etc. show that color pays. Color comes close to placing the products in
actual exhibition.
<p>But color used to amuse or to gain attention is like anything else that
we use for that purpose. It may attract many times as many people, yet
not secure a hearing from as many whom we want. The general rule applies.
Do nothing to merely interest, amuse, or attract. That is not your province.
Do only that which wins the people you are after in the cheapest possible
way.
<p>But these are minor questions. They are mere economies, not largely
affecting the results of a campaign.
<p>Some things you do may cut all your results in two. Other things can
be done which multiply those results.
<p>Minor costs are insignificant when compared with basic principles. One man 
  may do business in a shed, another in a palace. That is immaterial. The great 
  question is, ones power to get the maximum results.

<br>Chapter Ten
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Things Too Costly
<p>Many things are possible in advertising which are too costly to attempt.
That is another reason why every project and method should be weighed and
determined by a known scale of cost and result.
<p>Changing peoples habits is very expensive. A project which involves
that must be seriously considered. To sell shaving soap to the peasants
of Russia one would first need to change their beard wearing habits. The
cost would be excessive. Yet countless advertisers try to do things and
results are traced but unknown.
<p>For instance, the advertiser of a dentifrice may spend much space and
money to educate people to brush their teeth. Tests which we know of have
indicated that the cost of such converts may run from $20 to $25 each.
Not only because of the difficulty, but because much of the advertising
goes to people already converted.
<p>Such a cost, of course, is unthinkable. One might not in a lifetime
get it back in sales. The maker who learned these facts by tests make no
attempt to educate people to the tooth brush habit. What cannot be done
on a large scale profitably can not be done on a small scale. So not one
line in any ad is devoted to this object. This maker, who is constantly
guided in everything by keying every ad, has made remarkable success.
<p>Another dentifrice maker spends much money to make converts to the tooth
brush. The object is commendable, but altruistic. The new business he creates
is shared by his rivals. He is wondering why his sales increase is in no
way commensurate with his expenditure.
<p>An advertiser at one time spent much money to educate people to the
use of oatmeal. The results were too small to discover. All people know
of oatmeal. As a food for children it has age-old fame. Doctors have advised
it for many generations. People who don't serve oatmeal are therefore difficult
to start. Perhaps their objections are insurmountable. Anyway, the cost
proved to be beyond all possible return.
<p>There are many advertisers who know facts like these and concede them.
They would not think of devoting a whole campaign to any such impossible
object. Yet they devote a share of their space to that object. That is
only the same folly on a smaller scale. It is not good business.
<p>No one orange grower or raisin grower could attempt to increase the
consumption of those fruits. The cost might be a thousand times his share
of the returns. But thousands of growers combined have done it on those
and many other lines. There lies one of the great possibilities of advertising
development. The general consumption of scores of foods can be profitably
increased. But it must be done on wide co-operation.
<p>No advertiser could afford to educate people on vitamins or germicides.
Such things are done by authorities, through countless columns of unpaid-for
space. But great successes have been made by going to people already educated
and satisfying their created wants.
<p>It is a very shrewd thing to watch the development of a popular trend,
the creation of new desires. Then at the right time offer to satisfy those
desires. That was done on yeast's, for instance, and on numerous antiseptics.
It can every year be done on new things which some popular fashion or widespread
influence is brought into vogue. But it is a very different thing to create
that fashion, taste or influence for all in your field to share.
<p>There are some things we know of which might possibly be sold to half
the homes in the country. A Dakin-fluid germicide, for instance. But the
consumption would be very small. A small bottle might last for years.
<p>Customers might cost $1.50 each. And the revenue per customer might
not in ten years repay the cost of getting. Mail order sales on single
articles, however popular, rarely cost less that $42.50 each. It is reasonable
to suppose that sales made through dealers on like articles will cost approximately
as much. Those facts must be considered on any one-sale article. Possibly
one user will win others. But traced returns as in mail order advertising
would prohibit much advertising which is now being done.
<p>Costly mistakes are made by blindly following some ill-conceived idea.
An article, for instance, may have many uses, one of which is to prevent
disease. Prevention is not a popular subject, however much it should be.
<p>People will do much to cure trouble, but people in general will do little
to prevent it. This has been proved my many disappointments.
<p>One may spend much money in arguing prevention when the same money spent
on another claim would bring many times the sales. A heading which asserts
one claim may bring ten times the results of a heading which asserted another.
An advertiser may go far astray unless he finds out.
<p>A tooth paste may tend to prevent decay. It may also beautify teeth.
Tests will probably find that the latter appeal is many times as strong
as the former. The most successful tooth paste advertiser never features
tooth troubles in his headlines. Tests have proved them unappealing. Other
advertisers in this line center on those troubles. That is often because
results are not known and compared.
<p>A soap may tend to cure eczema. It may at the same time improve complexion.
The eczema claim may appeal to one in a hundred while the beauty claims
would appeal to nearly all. To even mention the eczema claims might destroy
the beauty claims.
<p>A man has a relief for asthma. It has done so much for him he considers
it a great advertising possibility. We have no statistics on this subject.
We do not know the percentage of people who suffer from asthma. A canvass
might show it to be one in a hundred. If so, he would need to cover a hundred
useless readers to reach one he wants. His cost of result might be twenty
times as high as on another article which appeals to one in five. That
excessive cost would probably mean disaster. For reasons like these every
new advertiser should seek for wise advice. No one with the interests of
advertising at heart will advise any dubious venture.
<p>Some claims not popular enough to feature in the main are still popular
enough to consider. They influence a certain number of people - say one-fourth
of your possible customers. Such claims may be featured to advantage in
a certain percentage of headlines. It should probably be included in every
advertisement. But those are not things to guess at. They should be decided
by actual knowledge, usually by traced returns.
<p>This chapter, like every chapter, points out a very important reason
for knowing your results. Scientific advertising is impossible without
that. So is safe advertising. So is maximum profit.
<p>Groping in the dark in this field has probably cost enough money to pay the 
  national debt. That is what has filled the advertising graveyards. That is what 
  has discouraged thousands who could profit in this field. And the dawn of knowledge 
  is what is bringing a new day in the advertising world.

<br>Chapter Eleven
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Information
<p>An ad-writer, to have a chance at success, must gain full information
on his subject. The library of an ad agency should have books on every
line that calls for research. A painstaking advertising man will often
read for weeks on some problem which comes up.
<p>Perhaps in many volumes he will find few facts to use. But some one
fact may be the keystone of success.
<p>This writer has just completed an enormous amount of reading, medical
and otherwise, on coffee. This is to advertise a coffee without caffeine.
One scientific article out of a thousand perused gave the keynote for that
campaign. It was the fact that caffeine stimulation comes two hours after
drinking. So the immediate bracing effects which people seek from coffee
do not come from the caffeine. Removing caffeine does not remove the kick.
It does not modify coffees delights, for caffeine is tasteless and odorless.
<p>Caffeineless coffee has been advertised for years. People regarded it
like near-beer. Only through weeks of reading did we find a way to put
it in another light.
<p>To advertise a tooth paste this writer has also ready many volumes of
scientific matter dry as dust. But in the middle of one volume he found
the idea which has helped make millions for that tooth paste maker. And
has made this campaign one of the sensations of advertising.
<p>Genius is the art of taking pains. The advertising man who spares the
midnight oil will never get very far.
<p>Before advertising a food product, 130 men were employed for weeks to
interview all classes of consumers.
<p>On another line, letters were sent to 12,000 physicians. Questionnaires
are often mailed to tens of thousands of men and women to get the viewpoint
of consumers.
<p>A $25,000-a-year man, before advertising outfits for acetylene gas,
spent weeks in going from farm to farm.
<p>Another man did that on a tractor.
<p>Before advertising a shaving cream, one thousand men were asked to state
what they most desired in a shaving soap.
<p>Called on to advertise pork and beans, a canvass was made of some thousand
of homes. There-to-fore all pork and bean advertising has been based on
"Buy my brand." That canvass showed that only 4 percent of the people used
any canned pork and beans. Ninety-six percent baked their beans at home.
The problem was not to sell a particular brand. Any such attempt appealed
to only four percent. The right appeal was to win the people away from
home-baked beans. The advertising, which without knowledge must have failed,
proved a great success.
<p>A canvas made, not only of homes, but of dealers. Competition is measured
up. Every advertiser of a similar product is written for his literature
and claims. Thus we start with exact information on all that our rivals
are doing.
<p>Clipping bureaus are patronized, so that everything printed on our subject
comes to the man who writes ads.
<p>Every comment that comes from consumers or dealers goes to this mans
desk.
<p>It is often necessary in a line to learn the total expenditure. We must
learn what a user spends a year, else we shall not know if users are worth
the cost of getting.
<p>We must learn the total consumption, else we may overspend.
<p>We must learn the percentage of readers to whom our product appeals.
We must often gather this data on classes. The percentage may differ on
farms and in cities. The cost of advertising largely depends on the percentage
of waste circulation.
<p>Thus an advertising campaign is usually preceded by a very large volume
of data. Even an experimental campaign, for effective experiments cost
a great deal of work and time.
<p>Often chemists are employed to prove or disprove doubtful claims. An
advertiser, in all good faith, makes an impressive assertion. If it is
true, it will form a big factor in advertising. If untrue, it may prove
a boomerang. And it may bar our ads from good mediums. It is remarkable
how often a maker proves wrong on assertions he had made for years.
<p>Impressive claims are made far more impressive by making them exact.
So, many experiments are made to get the actual figures. For instance,
a certain drink is known to have a large food value. That simple assertion
is not very convincing. So we send the drink to the laboratory and find
that its food value is 425 calories per pint. One pint is equal to six
eggs in calories of nutriment. That claim makes a great impression.
<p>In every line involving scientific details a censor is appointed. The
ad-writer, however well informed, may draw wrong inferences from facts.
So an authority passes on every advertisement. The uninformed would be
staggered to know the amount of work involved in a single ad. Weeks of
work sometimes. The ad seems so simple, and it must be simple to appeal
to simple people. But back of that ad may lie reams of data, volumes o
information, months of research.
<p>So this is no lazy mans field. 
<p><a NAME="ch12"></a> 
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Twelve
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Strategy
<p>Advertising is much like war, minus the venom. Or much, if you prefer,
like a game of chess. We are usually out
<p>to capture others' citadels or garner others' trade.
<p>We must have skill and knowledge. We must have training and experience,
also right equipment. We must have proper ammunition, and enough. We dare
not underestimate opponents. Our intelligence department is a vital factor,
as told in the previous chapter. We need alliances with dealers, as another
chapter tells. We also need strategy of the ablest sort, to multiply the
value of our forces.
<p>Sometimes in new campaigns comes the question of a name. That may be
most important. Often the right name is an advertisement in itself. It
may tell a fairly complete story, like Shredded Wheat, Cream of Wheat,
Puffed Rice, Spearmint Gum, Palmolive Soap, etc. That may be a great advantage.
The name is usually conspicuously displayed. Many a name has proved to
be the greatest factor in an articles success. Other names prove a distinct
disadvantage - Toasted Corn Flakes, for instance. Too many others may share
a demand with the man who builds it up.
<p>Many coined names without meaning have succeeded. Kodak, Karo etc.,
are examples. They are exclusive.
<p>The advertiser who gives them meaning never needs to share his advantage.
But a significant name which helps to impress a dominant claim is certainly
a good advantage. Names that tell stories have been worth millions of dollars.
So a great deal of research often precedes the selection of a name.
<p>Sometimes a price must be decided. A high price creates resistance.
It tends to limit ones field. The cost of getting an added profit may be
more than the profit.
<p>It is a well-known fact that the greatest profits are made on great
volume at small profit. Campbell's Soups, Palmolive Soap, Karo Syrup and
Ford cars are conspicuous examples. A price which appeals only to - say
10 percent - multiplies the cost of selling.
<p>But on other lines high price is unimportant. High profit is essential.
The line may have a small sale per customer. One hardly cares what he pays
for a corn remedy because he uses little. The maker must have a large margin
because of small consumption.
<p>On other lines a higher price may even be an inducement. Such lines
are judged largely by price. A product which costs more than the ordinary
is considered above the ordinary. So the price question is always a very
big factor in strategy.
<p>Competition must be considered. What are the forces against you? What
have they in price or quality or claims to weigh against your appeal? What
have you to win trade against them? What have you to hold trade against
them when you get it?
<p>How strongly are your rivals entrenched? There are some fields which
are almost impregnable. They are usually lines which create a new habit
or custom and which typify that custom with consumers. They so dominate
a field that one can hardly hope to invade it. They have volume, the profit
to make a tremendous fight.
<p>Such fields are being constantly invaded. But it is done through some
convincing advantage, or through very superior salesmanship-in-print.
<p>Other lines are only less difficult. A new shaving soap, as an example.
About every possible customer is using a rival soap. Most of them are satisfied
with it. Many are wedded to it. The appeal must be strong enough to win
those people from long-established favor.
<p>Such things are not accomplished by haphazard efforts. Not by considering
people in the mass and making blind stabs for their favors. We must consider
individuals, typical people who are using rival brands. A man on a Pullman,
for instance, using his favorite soap. What could you say to him in person
to get him to change to yours? We cannot go after thousands of men until
we learn how to win one.
<p>The maker may say that he has no distinctions. He is making a good product,
but much like others. He deserves a good share of the trade, but he has
nothing exclusive to offer. However, there is nearly always something impressive
which others have not told. We must discover it. We must have a seeming
advantage.
<p>People don't quit habits without reason.
<p>There is the problem of substitution and how to head it off. That often
steals much of ones trade. This must be considered in ones original plan.
One must have foresight to see all eventualities, and the wisdom to establish
his defenses in advance.
<p>Many pioneers in the line establish large demands. Then through some
fault in their foundations, lose a large share of the harvest. Theirs is
a mere brand, for instance, where it might have stood for an exclusive
product.
<p>Vaseline is an example. That product established a new demand, then
almost monopolized that demand through wisdom at the start. To have called
it some different brand of petroleum jelly might have made a difference
of millions in results.
<p>Jell-O, Postum, Victrola, Kodak, etc., established coined names which
came to typify a product. Some such names have been admitted to the dictionary.
They have become common names, though coined and exclusive.
<p>Royal Baking Powder and Toasted Corn Flakes, on the other hand, when
they pioneered their fields, left the way open to perpetual substitution.
So did Horlicks Malted Milk.
<p>The attitude of dealers must be considered. There is a growing inclination
to limit lines, to avoid duplicate lines, to lesson inventories. If this
applies to your line, how will dealers receive it? If there is opposition,
how can we circumvent it?
<p>The problems of distribution are important and enormous. To advertise
something that few dealers supply is a waste of ammunition. Those problems
will be considered in another chapter.
<p>These are samples of the problems which advertising men must solve.
These are some of the reasons why vast experience is necessary. One oversight
may cost the client millions in the end. One wrong piece of strategy may
prohibit success. Things done in one way may be twice as easy, half as
costly, as when done another way.
<p>Advertising without this preparation is like a waterfall going to waste.
The power might be there, but it is not made effective. We must center
the force and direct it in a practical direction.
<p>Advertising often looks very simple. Thousands of men claim ability to do it. 
  And there is still a wide impression that many men can. As a result, much advertising 
  goes by favor. But the men who know realize that the problems are as many and 
  as important as the problems in building a skyscraper. And many of them lie 
  in the foundations.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Thirteen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Use of Samples
<p>The product itself should be its own best salesman. Not the product
alone, but the product plus a mental
<p>impression, and atmosphere, which you place around it. That being so,
samples are of prime importance.
<p>However expensive, they usually form the cheapest selling method. A
salesman might as well go out without his
<p>sample case as an advertiser.
<p>Sampling does not apply to little things alone, like foods or proprietaries.
It can be applied in some way to
<p>almost every thing. We have sampled clothing. We are now sampling phonograph
records.
<p>Samples serve numerous valuable purposes. They enable one to use the
word "Free" in ads. That often
<p>multiplies readers. Most people want to learn about any offered gift.
Tests often show that samples pay for themselves - perhaps several times
over - in multiplying the readers of your ads without additional cost of
space.
<p>A sample gets action. The reader of your ad may not be convinced to
the point of buying. But he is ready to learn more about the product that
you offer. So he cuts out a coupon, lays it aside, and later mails it or
presents it.
<p>Without that coupon he would soon forget. Then you have the name and
address of an interested prospect. You can start him using your product.
You can give him fuller information. You can follow him up.
<p>That reader might not again read one of your ads in six months. Your
impression would be lost. But when he writes you, you have a chance to
complete with that prospect all that can be done. In that saving of waste
the sample pays for itself.
<p>Sometimes a small sample is not a fair test. Then we may send an order
on the dealer for a full-size package.
<p>Or we may make the coupon good for a package at the store. Thus we get
a longer test.
<p>You say that is expensive. So is it expensive to gain a prospects interest.
It may cost you 50 cents to get the person to the point of writing for
a sample. Don't stop at 15 cents additional to make that interest valuable.
<p>Another way in which samples pay is by keying your advertisements. They
register the interest you create.
<p>Thus you can compare one with another ad, headline, plan and method.
<p>That means in any line an enormous savings. The wisest, most experienced
man cannot tell what will most appeal in any line of copy. With a key to
guide you, your returns are very apt to cost you twice what they need cost.
And we know that some ads on the same product will cost ten times what
others cost. A sample may pay for itself several times over by giving you
an accurate check.
<p>Again samples enable you to refer customers where they can be supplied.
This is important before you attain general distribution.
<p>Many advertisers lose much by being penny-wise. They are afraid of imposition,
or they try to save pennies. That is why they ask ten cents for a sample,
or a stamp or two. Getting that dime may cost them from 40 cents to $1.
<p>That is, it may add that to the cost of replies. But it is remarkable
how many will pay that addition rather than offer a sample free.
<p>Putting a price on a sample greatly retards replies. Then it prohibits
you from using the word "Free," as we have stated, will generally more
than pay for your samples.
<p>For the same reason some advertisers say, "You buy one package, we will
buy the other." Or they make a coupon good for part of the purchase price.
Any keyed returns will clearly prove that such offers do not pay.
<p>Before a prospect is converted, it is approximately as hard to get half
price for your article as to get the full price for it.
<p>Bear in mind that you are the seller. You are the one courting interest.
Then don't make it difficult to exhibit that interest. Don't ask your prospects
to pay for your selling efforts. Three in four will refuse to pay - perhaps
nine in ten.
<p>Cost of requests for samples differ in every line. It depends on your
breadth of appeal. Some things appeal to everybody, some to a small percentage.
One issue of the papers in Greater New York brought 1,460,000
<p>requests for a can of evaporated milk. On a chocolate drink, one-fifth
the coupons published are presented. Another line not widely used may bring
a fraction of that number.
<p>But the cost of inquiries is usually enough to be important. Then don't
neglect them. Don't stint your efforts with those you have half sold. An
inquiry means that a prospect has read your story and is interested. He
or she
<p>would like to try your product and learn more about it. Do what you
would do if that prospect stood before you.
<p>Cost of inquiries depends largely on how they come. Asking people to
mail the coupon brings minimum returns. Often four times as many will present
that coupon for a sample at the store.
<p>On a line before the writer now, sample inquiries obtained by mail average
70 cents each. The same ads bring inquiries at from 18 cents to 22 cents
each when the coupons are presented at a local store.
<p>Most people write few letters. Writing is an effort. Perhaps they have
no stamps in the house. Most people will pay carfare to get a sample rather
than two cents postage. Therefore, it is always best, where possible, to
have samples delivered locally.
<p>On one line three methods were offered. The woman could write for a
sample, or telephone, or call at a store. Seventy percent of the inquiries
came by telephone. The use of the telephone is more common and convenient
than the use of stamps.
<p>Sometimes it is not possible to supply all dealers with samples. Then
we refer people to some central stores.
<p>These stores are glad to have many people come there. And other dealers
do not generally object so long as they share in the sales.
<p>It is important to have these dealers send you the coupons promptly.
Then you can follow up the inquiries while their interest is fresh.
<p>It is said that sample users repeat. They do to some extent. But repeaters
form a small percentage. Figure it in your cost.
<p>Say to the woman, "Only one sample to a home" and few women will try
to get more of them. And the few who cheat you are not generally the people
who would buy. So you are not losing purchasers, but the samples only.
<p>On numerous lines we have for long offered full-sized packages free.
The packages were priced at from 10 cents
<p>to 50 cents each. In certain territories for a time we have checked
up on repeaters. And we found the loss much less than the cost of checking.
<p>In some lines samples would be wasted on children, and they are most
apt to get them. Then say in your coupon "adults only." Children will not
present such coupons, and they will rarely mail them in.
<p>But one must be careful about publishing coupons good for a full-size
package at any store. Some people, and even dealers, may buy up many papers.
We do not announce the date of such offers. And we insert them in Sunday
papers, not so easily bought up.
<p>But we do not advocate samples given out promiscuously. Samples distributed
to homes, like waifs on the doorsteps, probably never pay. Many of them
never reach the house or the housewife. When they do, there is no prediction
for them. The product is cheapened. It is not introduced in a favorable
way.
<p>So with demonstrations in stores. There is always a way to get the same
results at a fraction of the cost. Many advertisers do not understand this.
They supply thousands of samples to dealers to be handed out as they will.
Could a trace be placed on the cost of returns, the advertiser would be
stunned.
<p>Give samples to interested people only. Give them only to people who
exhibit that interest by some effort. Give them only to people whom you
have told your story. First create an atmosphere of respect, a desire,
an expectation. When people are in that mood, your sample will usually
confirm the qualities you claim.
<p>Here again comes the advantage of figuring cost per customer. That is
the only way to gauge advertising.
<p>Samples sometimes seem to double advertising cost. They often cost more
than the advertising. Yet, rightly used, they almost invariably form the
cheapest way to get customers. And that is what you want.
<p>The argument against samples are usually biased. They may come from advertising 
  agents who like to see all the advertising money spent in print. Answer such 
  arguments by tests. Try some towns with them, some without. Where samples are 
  effectively employed, we rarely find a line where they do not lessen the cost 
  per customer.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  Chapter Fourteen <br>
  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
<p>Getting Distribution
<p>Most advertisers are confronted with the problem of getting distribution.
National advertising is unthinkable without that. A venture cannot be profitable
if nine in ten of the converts fail to find the goods.
<p>To force dealers to stock by bringing repeated demands may be enormously
expensive. To cover the country with a selling force is usually impossible.
To get dealers to stock an unknown line on promise of advertising is not
easy. They have seen too many efforts fail, too many promises rescinded.
<p>We cannot discuss all plans for getting distribution. There are scores
of ways employed, according to the enterprise. Some start by soliciting
direct sales - mail orders - until the volume of demand forces dealers
to supply.
<p>Some get into touch with prospects by a sample or other offer, then
refer them to certain dealers who are stocked.
<p>Some well-known lines can get a large percentage of dealers to stock
in advance under guarantee of sale. Some consign goods to jobbers so dealers
can easily order. Some name certain dealers in their ads until dealers
in general stock.
<p>The problems in this line are numberless. The successful methods are
many. But most of them apply to lines too few to be worthy of discussion
in a book like this.
<p>We shall deal here with articles of wide appeal and repeated sales,
like foods or proprietary articles.
<p>We usually start with local advertising, even though magazine advertising
is best adapted to the article. We get our distribution town by town, then
change to national advertising.
<p>Sometimes we name the dealers who are stocked. As others stock, we add
their names. When a local campaign is proposed, naming certain dealers,
the average dealer wants to be included. It is often possible to get most
of them by offering to name them in the first few ads.
<p>Whether you advertise few or many dealers, the others will stock in
very short order if the advertising is successful. Then the trade is referred
to all dealers.
<p>The sample plans dealt with in the previous chapter aid quick distribution.
They often pay for themselves in this way alone.
<p>If the samples are distributed locally, the coupon names the store.
The prospects who go there to get the samples know that those stores are
supplied, if a nearer dealer is not. Thus little trade is lost.
<p>When sample inquiries come to the advertiser, inquiries are referred
to certain dealers at the start. Enough demand is centered there to force
those dealers to supply it.
<p>Sometimes most stores are supplied with samples, but on the requirement
of a certain purchase. You supply a dozen samples with a dozen packages,
for instance. Then inquiries for samples are referred to all stores. This
quickly forces general distribution. Dealers don't like to have their customers
go to competitors even for a sample.
<p>Where a coupon is used, good at any store for a full-size package, the
problem of distribution becomes simple.
<p>Mail to dealers proofs of the ad which will contain a coupon. Point
out to each that many of his customers are bound to present that coupon.
Each coupon represents a cash sale at full profit. No average dealer will
let those coupon customers go elsewhere.
<p>Such a free-package offer often pays for itself in this way. It forms
the cheapest way of getting general distribution.
<p>Some of the most successful advertisers have done this in a national
way. They have inserted coupon ads in magazines, each coupon good at any
store for a full-size package. A proof of the ad is sent to dealers in
advance, with a list of the magazines to be used, and their circulation.
<p>In this way, in one week sometimes, makers attain a reasonable national
distribution. And the coupon ad, when it appears, completes it. Here again
the free packages cost less than other ways of forcing distribution. And
they start thousands of users besides. Palmolive Soap and Puffed Grains
are among the products which attain their distribution in that way.
<p>Half the circulation of a newspaper may go to outside towns. That half
may be wasted if you offer a sample at local stores. Say in your coupon
that outside people should write you for a sample. When they write, do
not mail the sample. Send the samples to a local store, and refer inquiries
to that store. Mailing a sample may make a convert who cannot be supplied.
But the store which supplies the sample will usually supply demand. In
these ways, many advertisers get national distribution without employing
a single salesman. They get it immediately.
<p>And they get it at far lower cost than by any other method. There are
advertisers who, in starting, send every dealer a few packages as a gift.
That is better, perhaps, than losing customers created. But it is very
expensive.
<p>Those free packages must be sold by advertising. Figure their cost at
your selling price, and you will see that you are paying a high cost per
dealer. A salesman might sell these small stocks at a lower cost. And other
methods might be vastly cheaper.
<p>Sending stocks on consignment to retailers is not widely favored. Many
dealers resent it. Collections are difficult. And non-business-like methods
do not win dealer respect.
<p>The plans advocated here are the best plans yet discovered for the lines
to which they apply. Other lines require different methods. The ramifications
are too many to discuss in a book like this.
<p>But don't start advertising without distribution. Don't get distribution
by methods too expensive. Or by slow, old-fashioned methods. The loss of
time may cost you enormously in sales. And it may enable energetic rivals
to get ahead of you.
<p>Go to men who know by countless experiences the best plan to apply to your 
  line.

<br>Chapter Fifteen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Test Campaigns
<p>Almost any questions can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally,
by a test campaign. And that's the way to answer them - not by arguments
around a table. Go to the court of last resort - the buyers of your product.
<p>On every new project there comes up the question of selling that article
profitably. You and your friends may like it, but the majority may not.
Some rival product may be better liked or cheaper. It may be strongly entrenched.
<p>The users won away from it may cost too much to get.
<p>People may buy and not repeat. The article may last too long. It may
appeal to a small percentage, so most of your advertising goes to waste.
<p>There are many surprises in advertising. A project you will laugh at
may make a great success. A project you are sure of may fall down. All
because tastes differ so. None of us know enough peoples desires to get
an average viewpoint.
<p>In the old days, advertisers ventured on their own opinions. The few
guess right, the many wrong. Those were the times of advertising disaster.
Even those who succeeded came close to the verge before the time is turned.
<p>They did not know their cost per customer or their sale per customer.
The cost of selling might take a long time to come back. Often it never
came back.
<p>Now we let the thousands decide what the millions will do. We make a
small venture, and watch cost and result. When we learn what a thousand
customers cost, we know almost exactly what a million will cost. When we
learn what they buy, we know what a million will buy.
<p>We establish averages on a small scale, and those averages always hold.
We know our cost, we know our sale, we know our profit and loss. We know
how soon our cost comes back. Before we spread out, we prove our undertaking
absolutely safe. So there are today no advertising disasters piloted by
men who know.
<p>Perhaps we try out our project in four or five towns. We may use a sample
offer or a free package to get users started quickly. Then we wait and
see if users buy those samples. If they do, will they continue? How much
will they buy? How long does it take for the profit to return our cost
of selling?
<p>A test like this may cost $3,000 to $5,000. It is not all lost, even
when the product proves unpopular. Some sales are made. Nearly every test
will in time bring back the entire cost.
<p>Sometimes we find that the cost of the advertising comes back before
the bills are due. That means that the product can be advertised without
investment. Many a great advertiser has been built up without any cost
whatever beyond immediate receipts. That is an ideal situation.
<p>On another product it may take three months to bring back the cost with
a profit. But one is sure of his profit in that time. When he spreads out
he must finance accordingly.
<p>Think what this means. A man has what he considers an advertising possibility.
But national advertising looks so big and expensive that he dare not undertake
it.
<p>Now he presents it in a few average towns, at a very moderate cost.
With almost no risk whatever. From the few thousand he learns what the
millions will do. Then he acts accordingly. If he then branches he knows
to a certainty just what his results will be.
<p>He is playing on the safe side of a hundred to one shot. If the article
is successful, it may make him millions. If he is mistaken about it, the
loss is a trifle.
<p>These are facts we desire to emphasize and spread. All our largest accounts
are now built in this way, from very small beginnings. When business men
realize that this can be done, hundreds of others will do it. For countless
fortune-earners now lie dormant.
<p>The largest advertiser in the world makes a business of starting such
projects. One by one he finds out winners. Now he has twenty-six, and together
they earn many millions yearly.
<p>These test campaigns have other purposes. They answer countless questions
which arise in business.
<p>A large food advertiser felt that his product would be more popular
in another form. He and all his advisers were certain about it. They were
willing to act on this supposition without consulting the consumers, but
wiser advice prevailed.
<p>He inserted an ad in a few towns with a coupon, good at any store for
a package of the new-style product. Then he wrote to the users about it.
They were almost unanimous in their disapproval.
<p>Later the same product was suggested in still another form. The previous
verdict made the change look dubious. The advertiser hardly thought a test
to be worth while. But he submitted the question to a few thousand women
in a similar way and 91 percent voted for it. Now he has a unique product
which promises to largely increase his sales.
<p>These tests cost about $1,000 each. The first one saved him a very costly
mistake. The second will probably bring him large profits.
<p>Then we try test campaigns to try out new methods on advertising already
successful. Thus we constantly seek for better methods, without interrupting
plans already proved out.
<p>In five years for one food advertiser we tried out over fifty separate
plans. Every little while we found an improvement, so the results of our
advertising constantly grew. At the end of five years we found the best
plan of all. It reduced our cost of selling by 75 percent. That is, it
was four times more effective than the best plan used before.
<p>That is what mail order advertisers do - try out plan after plan to
constantly reduce the cost. Why should any general advertiser be less business-like
and careful?
<p>Another service of the test campaign is this: An advertiser is doing
mediocre advertising. A skilled advertising agent feels that he can greatly
increase results. The advertiser is doubtful. He is doing fairly well.
He has alliances which he hesitates to break. So he is inclined to let
well enough alone.
<p>Now the question can be submitted to the verdict of a test. The new
agent may take a few towns, without interfering with the general campaign.
Then compare his results with the general results and prove his greater
skill.
<p>Plausible arguments are easy in this line. One man after another comes
to an advertiser to claim superior knowledge or ability. It is hard to
decide, and decisions may be wrong.
<p>Now actual figures gained at a small cost can settle the question definitely.
The advertiser makes no commitment. It is like saying to a salesman, "Go
out for a week and prove yourself." A large percentage of all the advertising
done would change hands if this method were applied.
<p>Again we come back to scientific advertising. Suppose a chemist would say in 
  an arbitrary way that this compound was best, or that better. You would little 
  respect his opinion. He makes tests - sometimes hundreds of tests - to actually 
  know which is best. He will never state a supposition before he has proved it. 
  How long before advertisers in general will apply that exactness to advertising?

<br>Chapter Sixteen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Leaning On Dealers
<p>We cannot depend much in most lines on the active help of jobbers or
of dealers. They are busy. They have many lines to consider. The profit
on advertised lines is not generally large. And an advertised article is
apt to be sold at cut prices.
<p>The average dealer does what you would do. He exerts himself on brands
of his own, if at all. Not on another mans brand.
<p>The dealers will often try to make you think otherwise. He will ask
some aid or concession on the ground of extra effort. Advertisers often
give extra discounts. Or they make loading offers - perhaps one case free
in ten -in the belief that loaded dealers will make extra efforts.
<p>This may be so in rare lines, but not generally. And the efforts if
made do not usually increase the total sales.
<p>They merely swing trade from one store to another.
<p>On most lines, making a sale without making a convert does not count
for much. Sales made by conviction - by advertising - are likely to bring
permanent customers. People who buy through casual recommendations do not
often stick. Next time someone else gives other advice.
<p>Revenue which belongs to the advertiser is often given away without
adequate return. These discounts and gifts could be far better spent in
securing new customers.
<p>Free goods must be sold, and by your efforts usually. One extra case
with ten means that advertising must sell ten percent more to bring you
the same return. The dealer would probably buy just as much if you let
him buy as convenient.
<p>Much money is often frittered away on other forms of dealer help. Perhaps
on window or store displays. A window display, acting as a reminder, may
bring to one dealer a lions share of the trade. Yet it may not increase
your total sales at all.
<p>Those are facts to find out. Try one town in one way, one in another.
Compare total sales in those towns. In many lines such tests will show
that costly displays are worthless. A growing number of experienced advertisers
spend no money on displays.
<p>This is all in line of general publicity, so popular long ago. Casting
bread upon the waters and hoping for its return. Most advertising was of
that sort twenty years ago.
<p>Now we put things to the test. We compare cost and result on every form
of expenditure. It is very easily done.
<p>Very many costly wastes are eliminated by this modern process.
<p>Scientific advertising has altered many old plans and conceptions. It
has proved many long established methods to be folly. And why should we
not apply to these things the same criterion we apply to other forms of
selling?
<p>Or to manufacturing costs?
<p>Your object in all advertising is to buy new customers at a price which
pays a profit. You have no interest in garnering trade at any particular
store. Learn what your consumers cost and what they buy. If they cost you
one dollar each, figure that every wasted dollar costs you a possible customer.
<p>Your business will be built in that way, not by dealer help. You must do your 
  own selling, make your own success. Be content if dealers fill the orders that 
  you bring. Eliminate your wastes. Spend all your ammunition where it counts 
  for most. 
<p><a NAME="ch17"></a> 
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Seventeen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Individuality
<p>A person who desires to make an impression must stand out in some way.
Being eccentric, being abnormal is not a distinction to covet. But doing
admirable things in a different way gives one a great advantage.
<p>So with salesmen, in person or in print. There is uniqueness which belittles
and arouses resentment. There is refreshing uniqueness which enhances,
which we welcome and remember. Fortunate is the salesman who has it.
<p>We try to give each advertiser a becoming style. We make him distinctive,
perhaps not in appearance, but in manner and in tone. He is given an individuality
best suited to the people he addresses.
<p>One man appears rugged and honest in a line where rugged honesty counts.
One may be a good fellow where choice is a matter of favor. In other lines
the man stands out by impressing himself as an authority.
<p>We have already cited a case where a woman made a great success in selling
clothing to girls, solely through a created personality which won.
<p>That's why we have signed ads sometimes - to give them a personal authority.
A man is talking - a man who takes pride in his accomplishments - not a
"soulless corporation." Whenever possible we introduce a personality into
our ads. By making a man famous we make his product famous. When we claim
an improvement, naming the man who made it adds effect.
<p>Then we take care not to change an individuality which has proved appealing.
Before a man writes a new ad on that line, he gets into the spirit adopted
by the advertiser. He plays a part as an actor plays it.
<p>In successful advertising great pains are taken to never change our
tone. That which won so many is probably the best way to win others. Then
people come to know us. We build on that acquaintance rather than introduce
a stranger in guise. People do not know us by name alone, but by looks
and mannerisms. Appearing different every time we meet never builds up
confidence.
<p>Then we don't want people to think that salesmanship is made to order.
That our appeals are created, studied, artificial. They must seem to come
from the heart, and the same heart always, save where a wrong tack forces
a complete change.
<p>There are winning personalities in ads as well as people. To some we are glad 
  to listen, others bore us. Some are refreshing, some commonplace. Some inspire 
  confidence, some caution. To create the right individuality is a supreme accomplishment. 
  Then an advertisers growing reputation on that line brings him ever-increasing 
  prestige. Never weary of that part. Remember that a change in our characteristics 
  would compel our best friends to get acquainted all over.

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Eighteen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Negative Advertising
<p>To attack a rival is never good advertising. Don't point out others'
faults. It is not permitted in the best mediums. It is never good policy.
The selfish purpose is apparent. It looks unfair, not sporty. If you abhor
knockers, always appear a good fellow.
<p>Show a bright side, the happy and attractive side, not the dark and
uninviting side of things. Show beauty, not homeliness; health, not sickness.
Don't show the wrinkles you propose to remove, but the face as it will
appear. Your customers know all about wrinkles.
<p>In advertising a dentifrice, show pretty teeth, not bad teeth. Talk
of coming good conditions, not conditions which exist. In advertising clothes,
picture well-dressed people, not the shabby. Picture successful men, not
failures, when you advertise a business course. Picture what others wish
to be, not what they may be now.
<p>We are attracted by sunshine, beauty, happiness, health, success. Then
point the way to them, not the way out of the opposite.
<p>Picture envied people, not the envious. Tell people what to do, not
what to avoid.
<p>Make your every ad breath good cheer. We always dodge a Lugubrious Blue.
<p>Assume that people will do what you ask. Say, "Send now for this sample."
Don't say, "Why do you neglect this offer?" That suggests that people are
neglecting. Invite them to follow the crowd.
<p>Compare the results of two ads, one negative, one positive. One presenting
the dark side, one the bright side. One warning, the other inviting. You
will be surprised. You will find that the positive ad out pulls the other
four to one, if you have our experience.
<p>The "Before and after taking" ads are follies of the past. They never had a 
  place save with the afflicted. Never let their memory lead you to picture the 
  gloomy side of things. 
<p><a NAME="ch19"></a> 
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Nineteen
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Letter Writing
<p>This is another phase of advertising which all of us have to consider.
It enters, or should enter, into all campaigns. Every business man receives
a large number of circular letters. Most of them go direct to the waste
basket. But he acts on others, and others are filed for reference.
<p>Analyze those letters. The ones you act on or the ones you keep have
a headline which attracted your interest. At a glance they offer something
that you want, something you may wish to know.
<p>Remember that point in all advertising.
<p>A certain buyer spends $50,000,000 per year. Every letter, every circular
which comes to his desk gets its deserved attention. He wants information
on the lines he buys.
<p>But we have often watched him. In one minute a score of letters may
drop into the waste basket. Then one is laid aside. That is something to
consider at once. Another is filed under the heading "Varnish." And later
when he buys varnish that letter will turn up.
<p>That buyer won several prizes by articles on good buying. His articles
were based on information. Yet the great masses of matter which came to
him never got more than a glance.
<p>The same principles apply to all advertising. Letter writers overlook
them just as advertisers do. They fail to get the right attention. They
fail to tell what buyers wish to know.
<p>One magazine sends out millions of letters annually. Some to get subscriptions,
some to sell books. Before the publisher sends out five million letters
he puts a few thousands to test. He may try twenty-five letters, each with
a thousand prospects. He learns what results will cost. Perhaps the plan
is abandoned because it appears unprofitable. If not, the letter which
pays best is the letter that he uses.
<p>Just as men are doing now in all scientific advertising.
<p>Mail order advertisers do likewise. They test their letters as they
test their ads. A general letter is never used until it proves itself best
among many actual returns.
<p>Letter writing has much to do with advertising. Letters to inquirers,
follow-up letters. Wherever possible they should be tested. Where that
is not possible, they should be based on knowledge gained by tests.
<p>We find the same difference in letters as in ads. Some get action, some
do not. Some complete a sale, some forfeit the impression gained. These
are letters, going usually to half-made converts, that are tremendously
important.
<p>Experience generally shows that a two-cent letter gets no more attention
than a one-cent letter. Fine stationery no more than poor stationery. The
whole appeal lies in the matter.
<p>A letter which goes to an inquirer is like a salesman going to an interested
prospect. You know what created that interest. Then follow it up along
that line, not on some different argument. Complete the impression already
created. Don't undertake another guess.
<p>Do something if possible to get immediate action. Offer some inducement
for it. Or tell what delay may cost.
<p>Note how many successful selling letters place a limit on an offer.
It expires on a certain date. That is all done to get prompt decision,
to overcome the tendency to delay.
<p>A mail order advertiser offered a catalog. The inquirer might send for
three or four similar catalogs. He had that competition in making a sale.
<p>So he wrote a letter when he sent his catalog, and enclosed a personal
card. He said, "You are a new customer, and we want to make you welcome.
So when you send your order please enclose this card. The writer wants
to see that you get a gift with order - something you can keep."
<p>With an old customer he gave some other reason for the gift. The offer
aroused curiosity. It gave preference to his catalog. Without some compelling
reason for ordering elsewhere, the woman sent the order to him. The gift
paid for itself several times over by bringing larger sales per catalog.
<p>The ways for getting action are many. Rarely can one way be applied
to two lines. But the principles are universal. Strike while the iron is
hot. Get a decision then. Have it followed by prompt action when you can.
<p>You can afford to pay for prompt action rather than lose by delay. One advertiser 
  induced hundreds of thousands of women to buy six packages of his product and 
  send him the trademarks, to secure a premium offer good only for one week. 
<p><a NAME="ch20"></a> 
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Chapter Twenty
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>A Name That Helps
<p>There is great advantage in a name that tells a story. The name is usually
prominently displayed. To justify the space it occupies, it should aid
the advertising. Some such names are almost complete advertisements in
themselves.
<p>May Breath is such a name. Cream of Wheat is another. That name alone
has been worth a fortune. Other examples are Dutch Cleanser, Cuticura,
Dynashine, Minute Tapioca, 3-in-one Oil, Holeproof, Alcorub, etc.
<p>Such names may be protected, yet the name itself describes the product,
so it makes a valuable display.
<p>Other coined names are meaningless. Some examples are Kodak, Karo, Sapolio,
Vaseline, Kotex, Lux, Postum, etc. They can be protected, and long-continued
advertising may give them a meaning. When this is accomplished they become
very valuable.
<p>But the great majority of them never attain status.
<p>Such names do not aid the advertising. It is very doubtful that they
justify display. The service of the product, not the name, is the important
thing in advertising. A vast amount of space is wasted in displaying names
and pictures which tell no selling story. The tendency of modern advertising
is to eliminate waste.
<p>Other coined names signify ingredients which anyone may use. Examples
are Syrup of Figs, Coconut Oil Shampoo, Tar Soap, Palmolive Soap, etc.
<p>Such products may dominate a market if the price is reasonable, but
they must to a degree meet competition. They invite substitution. They
are naturally classified with other products which have like ingredients,
so the price must remain in that class.
<p>Toasted Corn Flakes and Malted Milk are examples of unfortunate names.
In each of those cases one advertiser created a new demand. When the demand
was created, others shared it because they could use the name. The originators
depended only on a brand. It is interesting to speculate on how much more
profitable a coined name might have been.
<p>On a patented product it must be remembered that the right to a name
expires with that patent. Names like Castoria, Aspirin, Shredded Wheat
Biscuit, etc., have become common property.
<p>This is a very serious point to consider. It often makes a patent an
undesirable protection.
<p>Another serious fault in coined names is frivolity. In seeking uniqueness
one gets something trivial. And that is a fatal handicap in a serious product.
It almost prohibits respect.
<p>When a product must be called by a common name, the best auxiliary name
is a mans name. It is much better than a coined name, for it shows that
some man is proud of his creation.
<p>Thus the question of a name is of serious importance in laying the foundations 
  of a new undertaking. Some names have become the chief factors in success. Some 
  have lost for their originators four-fifths of the trade they developed.

<br>Chapter Twenty One
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Good Business
<p>A rapid stream ran by the writers boyhood home. The stream turned a
wooden wheel and the wheel ran a mill. Under that primitive method, all
but a fraction of the streams potentiality went to waste.
<p>Then someone applied scientific methods to that stream - put in a turbine
and dynamos. Now, with no more water, no more power, it runs a large manufacturing
plant.
<p>We think of that steam when we see wasted advertising power. And we
see it everywhere -hundreds of examples. Enormous potentialities - millions
of circulation - used to turn a mill wheel.
<p>While others use that same power with manifold effect.
<p>We see countless ads running year after year which we know to be unprofitable.
Men spending five dollars to do what one dollar might do. Men getting back
30 percent of their cost when they might get 150 percent. And the facts
could be easily proved.
<p>We see wasted space, frivolity, clever conceits, entertainment. Costly
pages filled with palaver which, if employed by a salesman, would reflect
on his sanity. But those ads are always unkeyed.
<p>The money is spent blindly, merely to satisfy some advertising whim.
<p>Not new advertisers only. Many an old advertiser has little or no idea
of his advertising results. The business is growing through many efforts
combined, and advertising is given its share of the credit.
<p>An advertiser of many years standing, spending as high as $700,000 per
year, told the writer he did not know whether his advertising was worth
anything or not. Sometimes he thought that his business would be just as
large without it.
<p>The writer replied, "I do know. Your advertising is utterly unprofitable,
and I could prove it to you next week. End an ad with an offer to pay five
dollars to anyone who writes you that he read the ad through. The scarcity
of replies will amaze you."
<p>Think what a confession - that millions of dollars being spent without
knowledge of results. Such a policy applied to all factors in a business
would bring ruin in short order.
<p>You see other ads which you may not like as well. They may seem crowded
or verbose. They are not attractive to you, for you are seeking something
to admire, something to entertain. But you will note that those ads are
keyed. The probability is that out of scores of traced ads the type which
you see has paid the best.
<p>Many other ads which are not keyed now were keyed at the beginning.
They are based on known statistics. They won on a small scale before they
ever ran on large scale. Those advertisers are utilizing their enormous
powers in full.
<p>Advertising is prima facie evidence that the man who pays believes that
advertising is good. It has brought great results to others, it must be
good for him. So he takes it like some secret tonic which others have endorsed.
If the business thrives, the tonic gets credit. Otherwise, the failure
is due to fate.
<p>That seems almost unbelievable. Even a storekeeper who inserts a twenty-dollar
ad knows whether it pays or not. Every line of a big stores ad is charged
to the proper department. And every inch used must the next day justify
its cost.
<p>Yet most national advertising is done without justification. It is merely
presumed to pay. A little test might show a way to multiply returns.
<p>Such methods, still so prevalent, are not very far from their end. The
advertising men who practice them see the writing on the wall. The time
is fast coming when men who spend money are going to know what they get.
Good business and efficiency will be applied to advertising. Men and methods
will be measured by the known returns, and only competent men can survive.
<p>Only one hour ago an old advertising man said to the writer, "The day
for our type is done. Bunk has lost its power. Sophistry is being displaced
by actuality. And I tremble at the trend."
<p>So do hundreds tremble. Enormous advertising is being done along scientific
lines. Its success is common knowledge. Advertisers along other lines will
not much longer be content.
<p>We who can meet the test welcome these changed conditions. Advertisers will 
  multiply when they see that advertising can be safe and sure. Small expenditures 
  made on a guess will grow to big ones on a certainty. Our line of business will 
  be finer, cleaner, when the gamble is removed. And we shall be prouder of it 
  when we are judged on merit.
