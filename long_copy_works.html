<p><a NAME="top"></a> Do long copy ads work? </p>
<p>Gary halbert says that if you has to choose your future wife based only on 
  a letter she wrote - you would want this letter to include as many details as 
  possible. Same with selling anything. you can't be too long - you can be too 
  boring. </p>
<p>Here is an article by George Demmer:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all my years of creating advertising, 
  there is one question that I have been asked more often than any other. One 
  issue that has caused me more problems with clients than any other. One particular 
  advertising and direct marketing approach that creates more concern and disbelief 
  than any other. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what is this troublesome question?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No one is really going to read all that
copy, are they?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, since I’m tired of answering
this question myself, I propose that we ask some of the all-time greats
in the history of advertising and direct marketing what they think about
this issue.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s see what they have to say...
<p>David Ogilvy (1911- )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Ogilvy is probably the most famous
advertising personality there is. He not only built the agency he founded,
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, into one of the biggest and most successful in the
world, he also wrote two popular books on the subject: Confessions of an
Advertising Man in 1963 and Ogilvy on Advertising in 1983.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Confessions, he had the following
to say on the subject of long copy:
<p>There is a universal belief in lay circles that people won’t read long
copy. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Claude Hopkins once wrote
five pages of solid text for Schlitz beer. In a few months, Schlitz moved
up from fifth place to first. I once wrote a page of solid text for Good
Luck Margarine, with most gratifying results.
<p>Every advertisement should be a complete sales pitch for your product.
It is unrealistic to assume that consumers will read a series of advertisements
for the same product. You should shoot the works in every advertisement,
on the assumption that it is the only chance you will ever have to sell
your product to the reader—now or never.
<p>Says Dr. Charles Edwards of the Graduate School of Retailing, at New
York University, “the more facts you tell, the more you sell. An advertisement’s
chance for success invariably increases as the number of pertinent merchandise
facts included in the advertisement increases.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ogilvy goes on to discuss some
of his personal experiences with long copy ads and shares an anecdote which
to this day remains the best explanation of what kind of copy people like
to read:
<p>Research shows that readership falls off rapidly up to 50 words of copy,
but drops very little between 50 and 500 words. In my first Rolls Royce
advertisement I used 719 words—piling one fascinating fact on another.
In the last paragraph I wrote, “people who feel diffident about driving
a Rolls Royce can buy a Bentley.” Judging from the number of motorists
who picked up the word “diffident” and bandied it about, I concluded that
the advertisement was thoroughly read. In the next one I used 1,400 words.
<p>We have even been able to get people to read long copy about gasoline.
One of our Shell advertisements contained 617 words, and 22% of male readers
read more than half of them.
<p>Vic Schwab [you’ll hear more from him later] tells the story of Max
Hart (of Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx) and his advertising manager, George
L. Dyer, arguing about long copy. Dyer said, “I’ll bet you $10 I can write
a newspaper page of solid type and you’d read every word of it.”
<p>Hart scoffed at the idea. “I don’t have to write a line of it to prove
my point,” Dyer replied. “I’ll only tell you the headline: ‘This Page is
All About Max Hart’.”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty years later, in Ogilvy on Advertising,
he had even more to say on the subject:
<p>All my experience says that for a great many products, long copy sells
more than short. [He then goes on to give numerous examples of successful
long copy ads.] I could give you countless other examples of long copy
which has made the cash register ring, notably for Mercedes cars. Not only
in the United States, but all over the world.
<p>I believe, without any research to support me, that advertisements with
long copy convey the impression that you have something important to say,
whether people read the copy or not.
<p>Direct response advertisers know that short copy doesn’t sell. In split
run tests, long copy invariably outsells short copy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, he explains one of the most important
differences between the long and short copy styles of advertising:
<p>Advertising people have an unconscious belief that advertisements have
to look like advertisements. They have inherited graphic conventions which
telegraph to the reader, "This is only an advertisement. Skip it."
<p>There is no law which says that advertisements have to look like advertisements.
If you make them look like editorial pages, you will attract more readers.
Roughly six times as many people read the average article as the average
advertisement. Very few advertisements are read by more than one reader
in twenty. I conclude that editors communicate better than admen.
<p>If you pretend you are an editor, you will get better results. When
the magazine insists that you slug your ads with the word advertisement,
set it in italic caps, in reverse. Then nobody can read it.
<p>If you abandon the conventional graphics of advertisements and adopt
editorial graphics, your campaigns will become islands of good taste in
an ocean of vulgarity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a later chapter, Ogilvy puts an exclamation
point on his argument:
<p>Long copy sells more than short copy, particularly when you are asking
the reader to spend a lot of money. Only amateurs use short copy.
<p>John Caples (1900-1990)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Caples is considered by many in
the industry as the ultimate guru of advertising, and his book, Tested
Advertising Methods is the closest thing there is to an advertising bible.
Originally written in 1938, Caples himself revised the book four times
until the late 70’s, and a fifth edition, published in 1997 and edited
by Fred Hahn, has been issued posthumously. Here’s what he has to say on
our subject:
<p>The short copy ads, set in poster style and containing only a few words
of copy or a slogan, are usually used by advertisers who are unable to
trace the direct sales results from their advertisements.
<p>Advertisers who can trace the direct sales results from their ads use
long copy because it pulls better than short copy. For example, the book
club advertisers, the record clubs, and the correspondence school advertisers
use ads containing 500 to 1500 words of copy. Also, you will find that
real-estate advertisers, patent medicine advertisers, and classified advertisers
put as much selling copy into their ads as the space will allow. These
people cannot afford to run so-called “reminder copy.” They have to get
immediate sales from every ad.
<p>Advertisers who sell their goods and services by means of direct mail
letters have found it profitable to use long copy in their advertising.
Long copy is such a tested and proven success that the four-page direct
mail letter has become a rule rather than an option. Where the instruction
used to be “Say whatever you must say, then stop,” it now is, “Say it in
four pages and make it worth reading.”
<p>This does not mean that long copy should be used merely for the sake
of filling space. Long copy should be used in order to crowd in as many
sales arguments as possible.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some additional points Caples
makes with regard to length of copy:
<p>Advocates of short copy say, “I don’t think anybody will read all that
small print. Let’s cut the copy down to a couple of paragraphs and set
it in 18-point type.”
<p>What the advocates of short copy should say, if they want to be accurate,
is this: “I don’t think everybody will read all that small print.” This
is perfectly true. Everybody will not read it. But the fact is that the
very people you are most interested in will read your ad. These are the
prospects who will buy your product or service if you tell them sufficient
reasons for doing so.
<p>The question arises: Why wouldn’t it pay the short-copy users to make
their advertising do the utmost selling job by including more sales talk?
Answer: the chances are that it would pay them.
<p>Here is a solution to the problem of long copy versus short copy that
should satisfy the champions of both sides of the question. Put a brief
selling message into your headline and subheadings. Put your detailed message
into small print. In this way, you accomplish two things: (1) You get a
brief message across to glancers with your headline and subheads. (2) You
give a complete message in small print to the person who is sufficiently
interested in your product to read about it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in Tested Advertising Methods Caples
goes on to say:
<p>After you have found your most efficient size ad, you should jam your
space full of copy, no matter whether it is a one-inch ad or a full-page
ad.
<p>Brief, reminder-style copy consisting of a few words or a slogan does
not pull inquiries as well as long copy packed with facts and reader benefits
about your product or service.
<p>If you want to see efficient use of space, look at mail order catalogs
or at the mail-order ads in magazines or in your Sunday newspaper. Some
of the strongest-pulling mail-order ads have contained as many as 1200
words of copy set in small print. Don’t be afraid to use long copy or small
print. Just be sure that your copy is interesting.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his 1983 book How to Make Your Advertising
Make Money, Caples says:
<p>Ads with lots of facts are effective. And don’t be afraid of long copy.
If your ad is interesting, people will read all the copy you can give them.
If the ad is dull, short copy won’t save it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the book, he devotes an entire
chapter to long copy ads entitled “How Editorial Style Ads can Bring Increased
Sales.” After discussing numerous highly successful examples he says:
<p>If you use the editorial style approach, you will have a powerful factor
working in your favor. People buy newspapers and magazines to read editorial
material—not ads. Readership studies show that the reading of editorial
material is five times as great as the reading of advertising.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we’ve heard from—arguably—the
two most famous men in advertising history, let’s ask some of the real
pioneers in the field for their views on long copy.
<p>Claude Hopkins (1867-1932)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claude Hopkins was one of the first to
carefully study and test the results of different approaches in advertising.
He is believed to have coined the term “scientific advertising” to describe
the approach, and his 1923 book by that name remains one of the all-time
classics in the field. Not only did his work inspire many of the advertising
giants who came after him, but much of his work and his methods are as
applicable today as they were in his day.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider his thoughts on our question:
<p>Some say, “Be very brief. People will read but little.” Would you say
that to a salesman? With the prospect standing before him, would you confine
him to any certain number of words? That would be an unthinkable handicap.
<p>So in advertising. The only readers we get are people whom our subject
interests. No one reads ads for amusement, long or short. Consider them
as prospects, standing before you, seeking for information. Give them enough
to get action.
<p>The motto ... is, "The more you tell the more you sell." and it has
never failed to prove out so in any test we know.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spends an entire chapter, called “Tell
Your Full Story,” explaining—with numerous examples—the critical importance
of presenting a complete sales argument in every advertisement:
<p>When you once get a person’s attention, then is the time to accomplish
all you ever hope with him. Bring all your good arguments to bear. Cover
every phase of your subject. One fact appeals to some, one to another.
Omit any one and a certain percentage will lose the fact which might convince.
... So present to the reader, when once you get him, every important claim
you have.
<p>The best advertisers do that. They learn their appealing claims by tests—by
comparing results from various headlines. Gradually they accumulate a list
of claims important enough to use. All those claims appear in every ad
thereafter.
<p>This again brings up the question of brevity. The most common expression
you hear about advertising is that people will not read much. Yet a vast
amount of the best paying advertising shows that people do read much.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopkins gives the simple example of trying
to convince someone, face-to-face, to change their favourite brand of breakfast
food, toothpaste, or soap and adopt a new one. He says:
<p>A man who once does that at a woman’s door won’t argue for brief advertisements.
He will never again say, "A sentence will do," or a name or claim or boast.
<p>Nor will the man who traces his results. Note that brief ads are never
keyed. Know that every traced ad tells the complete story though it takes
columns to tell.
<p>Maxwell Sackheim (1890-1982)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max Sackheim was a pioneer in the direct
marketing field. In addition to being a famous copywriter (his ad headlined
“Do You Make These Mistakes in English?” is one of the most famous and
successful ever written and ran profitably for over 40 years), he invented
the Book-of-the-Month Club and the negative option approach which have
both been adopted by countless companies since then.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s his point of view:
<p>I have never been able to understand why so many advertisers are afraid
to use long copy when there’s so much evidence to prove its value; so much
in fact that the only reason for using short copy is when there isn’t much
to say.
<p>One good test of copy is whether or not it can be cut. If it can be
cut, cut it. But when cutting is hard work, you are getting down to bedrock.
Tell your story fully and completely. If you can tell it in ten words,
fine. But if you need a thousand words, nothing less is fair to the space
you pay for.
<p>Victor O. Schwab
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victor Schwab is the author of one of
the classic works on advertising, How to Write a Good Advertisement, which
was first published in 1962 after he had spent 44 years as an advertising
copywriter. An entire chapter of the book is devoted to “How Long Should
the Copy Be?” and it contains one of the most complete and well argued
explanations of copy length found anywhere.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are a few of his thoughts:
<p>Advertisers who are able to check their advertising and sales results
carefully have discovered an astonishing relationship between effectiveness
and number of words used. They have found that—unless copy is exceptionally
fine or exceptionally bad—these ratios of resultfullness to copy length
are fairly constant.
<p>The LONGER your copy can hold the interest of the greatest number of
readers, the likelier you are to induce MORE of them to act.
<p>Because the sludge of human inertia is so stagnant that too small an
amount of copy cannot make that sludge flow into action—unless (and usually
even though) the quality of the copy, or the inherent appeal of the product,
is tremendously far above average. And it’s a rare copy idea that can be
presented with great brevity and still get immediate action.
<p>To sum up: the longer your copy can hold people, the more of them you
will sell; and the more interesting your copy is, the longer you will hold
them. If you can keep your reader interested, you’ll have a better chance
of propelling him to action. If you cannot do that, then too small an amount
of copy won’t push him far enough along that road anyway.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, Schwab discusses the reasons
why people will read long copy:
<p>What subject interests your reader most? Himself, and his family. So
... your copy subject is what your product will do for him, or for his
family.
<p>It’s amazing how much copy any person will read, willingly, if it continues
to point out these consumer benefits; if you keep making your product win
advantages for him.
<p>Continuously interesting presentation of strong consumer-benefit sales
angles justifies and rewards the use of longer copy.
<p>A salesman does not say, “How do you do?” speak a few words about his
product, then ask you to sign the order. No; he uses enough words to get
your emotions and reasoning power flowing toward a sale.
<p>Yet many advertisements virtually say little more than “Hello—Our product
is wonderful—Good-by.”
<p>Likewise, it is obvious (but often overlooked) that no reader can be
influenced by good sales angles which don’t appear in the advertisement
at all.
<p>In other words, if these sales angles aren’t in the copy, then ... readers
can’t be influenced by them. But if they are there, they at least have
the chance of influencing all your readers. And you cannot shorten copy
too much, merely for the greater attraction of some people, without running
the risk of leaving too little of it to do a good job of selling the others.
<p>Attempting to compromise with this fact, many advertisers try, in effect,
to make a deal with the reader. They make dull advertisements short. Yet
mere brevity does not make an otherwise dull advertisements interesting—any
more than mere length makes an otherwise interesting advertisement dull.
Real interest will induce a reader to read longer copy, word by word, whereas
the lack of it will not induce him to read even shorter copy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schwab hits the nail right on the head
when he quotes a remark attributed to Howard G. Sawyer: “Long copy doesn’t
scare away readers the way it scares away advertisers.” Now if only advertisers
began to realize that…I wouldn’t have a reason to write this article!
<p>Bob Stone
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Stone, founder of Stone &amp; Adler,
one of the leading Direct Marketing advertising agencies in the world,
is the author of Successful Direct Marketing Methods, the bible of the
direct marketing field. In the fourth edition of the book, published in
1988, he says:
<p>“Do people read long copy?” The answer is yes! People will read something
for as long as it interests them. An uninteresting one-page letter can
be too long. A skillfully woven four-pager can hold the reader until the
end. Thus, a letter should be long enough to cover the subject adequately
and short enough to retain interest. Don’t be afraid of long copy. If you
have something to say and can say it well, it will probably do better than
short copy. After all, the longer you hold a prospect’s interest, the more
sales points you can get across and the more likely you are to win an order.
<p>Walter H. Weintz
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walter Weintz is another direct marketing
legend, and was one of the pioneers in magazine and book subscription direct
mail when he worked at Reader’s Digest. In his 1987 book The Solid Gold
Mail Box, he shares his thoughts on long copy direct marketing letters:
<p>...a question that always comes up, when a mail-order practitioner attempts
to explain his [use of long copy], is “wouldn’t a postcard be more effective?”
<p>And usually the observation is added, “personally, I never read all
that junk I get in third class mailings. Really now, why do you have to
write four-page letters? Wouldn’t a one-page letter do just as well, or
even better?”
<p>The answer is, a 4-page letter will generally pull twice as many orders
as a one-page letter, provided that the copywriter has something to say,
and says it with some skill. This isn’t just an opinion: it has been proved
over and over, by tests—where a skeptical client has prepared a one-page
letter, in finest prose, and tested it against a long-winded 4-pager.
<p>In fact, Meredith Publishing Company (publishers of Better Homes and
Gardens and Modern Living magazines, as well as numerous books and clubs)
generally prefers a six-page letter-because their tests have proved that
a good 6-pager pulls even better than a 4-pager!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in case you’re thinking that only
old-timers and long-dead marketing pioneers hold these points of view,
let’s visit with a few of today’s generation of marketing gurus and experts.
<p>Robert W. Bly
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Bly is a top-notch copywriter and
prolific author. In his 1985 book The Copywriter’s Handbook, which received
a glowing recommendation from David Ogilvy himself, he has this to say
on the subject of long copy:
<p>The length of the copy—and the number of sales points to include—is
something you, the copywriter, must decide for each project. However, I
offer this piece of advice: if you’re unsure of how long to make the copy,
you’re better off including too much information than not enough information.
<p>There are many studies that confirm that, all else being equal, long-copy
ads sell more effectively than short ones. For example, a recent survey
of 72 retailers measured the “success ratio” of their ads against the number
of merchandise facts each ad contained.
<p>[Here he has a table showing a steady increase in success ratio as the
number of merchandise facts increase.]
<p>As you can see, the more facts included, the more successful the ad.
The study also revealed that whenever a store omitted any essential information
from an advertisement, sales response was instantly reduced.
<p>Don’t be afraid of long copy. Include as many facts as it takes to make
the sale.
<p>Gary C. Halbert
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary Halbert is one of today’s highest
paid marketing gurus and has made millions with his own direct marketing
companies. He is the author of the 1990 book How To Make Maximum Money
In Minimum Time!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his secrets to profitable newspaper
advertising is to:
<p>MAKE YOUR AD LOOK LIKE A NEWS STORY. Don’t make it look like an ad.
Don’t use line art. Don’t use arrows, cute graphics, reverse type (except
maybe to highlight a phone number), weird typestyles...OR ANYTHING ELSE
THAT MIGHT WIN AN AWARD FOR GRAPHIC DESIGN.
<p>Come closer. Listen: here is how to “think” about your newspaper ads.
Think about what could be the best possible piece of luck you could have.
Think about a reporter who heard a rumor about your product or service
and decided to check it out. And then, he fell in love with it. In fact,
he loved it so much, he went back to his typewriter and wrote a full-page
rave article about what you are selling.
<p>Wouldn’t that be nice? Sure would. However, it is also unlikely that
such a thing will happen. So...YOU BE THAT REPORTER!
<p>You write the rave “article.” Just like a reporter would. And, at the
end of the article, you perform a “public service” for your readers by
telling them where and how to order. But, after all this, don’t screw up
by having your “article” typeset to look like an ad.
<p>No. No. Noooo. It should be typeset to look like the “article” it is.
You know, ad agencies just love to quote studies that prove how much people
love to read advertising.
<p>Garbage! Garbage! Garbage!
<p>Editorial material (or material that appears to be editorial) gets 500%
more readership than material that is obviously advertising.
<p>Craig Huey
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig Huey is a California-based direct
response advertising expert. His thoughts about long copy are quoted in
the 1998 book 2,239 Tested Secrets for Direct Marketing Success:
<p>Long copy works. The more you tell, the more you sell. In fact, the
reason ads don’t do as well as direct mail is you don’t have the space
to tell your story as strongly. In just one study, McGraw-Hill reviewed
3,597 ads in 26 business magazines. It found that ads with 300 or more
words were more effective than shorter ads in creating awareness of the
product, prompting action, and reinforcing a buying decision.
<p>A few years back, Merrill Lynch ran a very long ad in the New York Times.
Its 6,450 words received a lot of criticism for being “ugly,” for having
“too much copy and not enough graphics.” The headline was long, too: “What
Everybody Ought to Know About This Stock and Bond Business.”
<p>Despite all the negative reviews, it received 10,000 responses without
even a coupon.
<p>Jay Abraham
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay Abraham is one of today’s most respected—and
highly paid—marketing consultants and is the author of Getting Everything
You Can Out of All You’ve Got, a book published in 2000. Talking about
sales letters he says:
<p>Should your letter or E-mail be long or short? Make it long enough to
tell a complete, informative, and interesting story. People think others
won’t read long, multipage letters. That couldn’t be further from the truth.
You’ll read any number of pages if a letter captures your interest. Make
your sales letter long enough to tell a complete story and to thoroughly
address all the necessary components.
<p>Don’t shortcut to save space. Edit ruthlessly for waste or boring content
(this is particularly true with E-mail), but never jettison fascinating
facts, forceful reasons, or specific information that adds to your compelling
story.
<p>If you had a salesperson calling on a client, would you tell that person
to stop the presentation after thirty seconds to save time? Of course not.
You want that salesperson to take as much time as necessary to make a compelling
case. That also applies to sales letters.
<p>My most successful sales letters have been eight, ten, twelve, even
sixteen pages long. But every paragraph was informative, and every section
advanced the case. If you have a hobby or a profession, how much will you
read on that subject? A page? A chapter? A book? The answer is: a lot.
Provided it is interesting. If your sales letters are interesting, people
will gladly read them.
<p>Jay Conrad Levinson
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay Conrad Levinson is the author of
the number one best selling marketing series of all time, the Guerrilla
Marketing books. In Guerrilla Marketing Attack (1989) he says:
<p>Remember that long copy works better than short copy. Of all the things
people dislike about marketing, “lack of information” comes in second.
[“Feeling deceived” is first.]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Guerrilla Advertising, a 1994 sequel,
he adds:
<p>Print ads that look like a newspaper story and have a newsy headline
are another sage use of the print media. People read newspapers to get
the news, and if you’ve got some, tell it. They read magazines so they
can become involved with the stories. Let them become involved with your
ad.
<p>Many of the most successful print ads are long-copy ads with headlines
that begin with the words “How to.” ...prospects hang on to every word.
Don’t be deluded into thinking people won’t read long copy. They will if
it interests them. And they will if it solves one of their problems. The
sheer quantity of your copy will impress many prospects who won’t even
read it, but will figure that if you have that much to say about your offering,
it must be worthwhile.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another 1994 addition to the series,
The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook, co-authored with Seth Godin, he sums
up the issue very nicely:
<p>Don’t be afraid to use lengthy copy. It’s been statistically proven
time and time again that ads with more copy draw better than those with
less. You want to give the reader as much of the story about your product
or service as possible. Tell a story that will compel them to buy.
<p>So what do you think now?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one of the authors I have quoted
is a giant in the field of advertising. Between them, they have written
advertising that has sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of products
spanning the entire twentieth century. Every one of them built their career
on producing advertisements that worked phenomenally well for their clients.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they all agree about the effectiveness
of long copy ads. If you were to review the work they produced during their
advertising careers you would see that they practiced what they preached.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think they could all be wrong?
Not too damn likely is it?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think you know more about the
subject than they do? Do you really want to ignore their experience and
research?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I’ve only touched the tip of the
iceberg, of course. I’ve provided you with a few brief quotes from some
of the greatest men in advertising history. But every marketing person
who has tested and tracked the results of their advertisements could vouch
for the same thing. And I could share with you hundreds of additional quotes
from marketing books, research papers, and articles that would reiterate
the same conclusions over and over again.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the next time some uneducated advertising
sales person, graphic designer, or self-proclaimed (and self-deluded) marketing
expert tells you that “No one will read all that copy,” you know what to
do: hand them a copy of this article and suggest that they should really
do a little research before making such foolish statements.
<p>Summing up
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let’s sum up what we’ve learned from
the advertising greats about long copy ads:
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; People will read long copy as long as it interests
them. The people that won’t read long copy are the ones who aren’t interested
in your product anyway. No advertisement will change their mind, regardless
of the number of words it contains. Real prospects want to know as much
as they can in order to make a sound decision.
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are primarily interested in themselves,
their families, or their businesses. They are not interested in your company,
product, or service in any other way except for the benefits it will bring
to them. As long as the copy continues to focus on their self-interest,
it will keep their attention.
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; People read newspapers and magazines for the stories
and articles they contain, not for the ads. In fact, most people scan the
headlines for articles of interest to them while purposely avoiding anything
that looks like advertising. As a result, advertising that contains a headline
which attracts their interest and looks like the editorial content around
it is much more likely to be read than advertising which looks like advertising.
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of advertising is to motivate and bring
about the desired action in the reader, such as an order, phone call, or
visit to your place of business. For most products and services, a picture
and a few words are highly unlikely to attain the desired response. Your
ad needs to do what a salesman would do when face to face with a prospect
and provide a complete presentation of the product or service benefits.
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, every advertisement should tell
the full and complete story. It should contain all the strongest and most
persuasive reasons for a prospect to do business with you. And for those
who are either too lazy or in too much of a hurry to read all the fine
print, you should include subheads throughout which summarize the main
points of the ad for these quick scanners.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With over a century of practical experience,
thorough testing and research, and the collective recommendation of some
of the great names in advertising history behind it, you can take this
approach to the bank. Long copy advertising works.
<p>Yes, but...
<p>1. “I’ve seen research that says otherwise”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is true that supporters of short
copy advertising can produce research which seems to support their point
of view. But if you begin to dig into this “research” a little deeper,
you’ll find it doesn’t stand up to the scrutiny.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, you’ll find that much of the research
is academic in nature. This means it was done in a laboratory, not the
real world. In most cases, student volunteers—who are not real prospects
for the product or service in question—are shown a series of ads and asked
which ones they “liked” best. Not surprisingly, they choose attractive
or amusing ads. You would never get the same results in the real world
where actual prospects and actual sales are being counted.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second type of research which seems
to contradict the recommendations I’m making is a favourite of the big
general advertising agencies. They measure for what is known as an “advertising
recall” score and they conclude that the more people remember the advertising,
the better it is. Once again, volunteers who are not true prospects for
the products or services involved are shown a random series of advertisements.
Then, at varying time intervals, they are asked which ones they remember.
Now let me ask you which would you remember: a pink elephant with green
polka dots being ridden by a naked 300-pound woman—or an ad with a simple
product picture and lots of strong selling copy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You guessed it! The naked woman on the
elephant achieves a significantly higher recall score and is deemed to
be the better advertisement. Now, unless you’re selling pink and green
elephants—or 300-pound naked women—your ad may be remembered, but it’s
not likely to sell much.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think my example is too outrageous
to be realistic, try a little experiment: see how many television commercials
you remember. Now see if you remember what those commercials were in fact
selling. And finally, ask yourself if you’ve actually purchased any of
those products or services. Unless you are a particularly astute student
of television commercials, chances are you couldn’t remember what most
of them were selling. If you actually buy any of the products, my guess
is that you were already doing so before the commercials aired. And remember,
we’re talking about television commercials here that you have probably
seen many, many times. “Memorable” print advertisements are even less likely
to work.
<p>2. “If this is true, why doesn’t everyone know about it—and do it?”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s a valid question and there isn’t
one simple answer. But here are a few possible reasons.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, most of the people involved in
creating advertising are amateurs who have never seriously studied the
subject. They are salespeople who sell advertising space. They are graphic
designers who provide the “free layout services” for newspapers, magazines,
and yellow pages directories. They are free-lance artists, desktop publishers,
print shops, and other business service providers who add “advertising
layout” to their list of services—but don’t bother to study the subject
beyond browsing ads themselves.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people speak authoritatively on
the subject of advertising. They assume that they know a great deal about
it because they work with advertising every day. They pick up tidbits of
advertising wisdom from colleagues, managers, the advertisers themselves,
and other assorted purveyors of “old wives’ tales.” It may be fascinating
and amusing—but it’s nowhere close to the truth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a second group of people who
bring confusion to the issue in a different way. They are the advertising
and marketing people who studied the subject in the academic world. They
present impressive credentials like business administration degrees, marketing
degrees, and MBAs. Many of them have significant work experience as marketing
managers or consultants. Surely, they must know what they’re talking about.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, they don’t—not on this
subject anyway. Business schools, you see, teach marketing from the point
of view of the giant corporation: McDonald’s, Budweiser, Ford, IBM...the
places where marketing budgets are measured in the hundreds of millions.
These are the companies that can afford to “build their brand recognition,”
use “reminder” ads, and count on frequent repetition to boost their market
shares by fractions of a percent. Unless you’re working with the same kind
of a budget, you can’t.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only place you’ll go by listening
to the advice of one of these “academic marketers” is bankruptcy court.
Because they haven’t studied scientific, tested advertising methods where
actual sales are the only measure of effectiveness, and they haven’t practiced
their craft in the real world where each advertisement needs to produce
profitable results, they wrongly assume that their Fortune 500 marketing
methods apply to all businesses.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is a “blind leading the
blind” element at work. When people go into business, they assume that
bigger competitors must know what they’re doing. They figure that the advertising
they see everywhere they look, especially the kind placed by big, successful
companies, must be the right way—and proceed to imitate it. And, of course,
they are reinforced in their decisions by the two misguided groups mentioned
above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost in this great sea of marketing idiocy
are the lonely voices of the marketers who have done their homework, who
have practiced and experimented in the real world. Make sure you don’t
ignore them just because they are in the minority.
<p>3. “The newspaper, magazine, and yellow pages publishers don’t want
me to do long copy ads”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publishers often seem to go to great
lengths to talk you out of running long copy advertising. Why is that?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues we’ve already covered above
explain most of the problem, but there are a few other points worth mentioning.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it is obviously far cheaper, easier,
and quicker to produce low-copy or poster style advertising. A stock photo
or piece of clip art, the company name and logo, a few “clever” words of
copy or a slogan, and you’re done! Next…! Anyone with a basic grasp of
graphic design or page layout software and a minimal amount of good taste
can perform the task in just a few minutes. (Sadly, some publishers don’t
even include the minimal amount of good taste in their qualification requirements.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since publishers usually offer these
design services free of charge to advertisers, they are not about to hire
highly skilled copywriters and marketers. The last thing they want you
to do is to start a trend and have their other advertisers begin asking
them to create high copy ads.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newspaper and magazine publishers—and
by extension their sales representatives—are also huge fans of reminder
advertising. “Keep your name in front of the customer,” they tell you,
recommending that you place ads in every issue of their publication so
that their readers can’t possibly forget you. They are right—up to a point,
of course—because readers won’t forget something they never notice in the
first place. The motivation for this seemingly helpful suggestion is quite
transparent: A “reminder” advertiser never needs to be sold advertising
space again, an ideal scenario for the sales rep and publisher alike.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, magazines and newspapers are
concerned that editorial style ads will compete with the actual editorial
material in their publication and confuse their readers. This is not an
unreasonable concern—and is in fact exactly what you hope to accomplish
as an advertiser—but chances are that there will never be more than a handful
of advertisers using this technique thanks to the overwhelming majority
of the short-copy advocates. And besides, it’s really not your problem.
<p>4. “I showed people some long copy ads, and they told me they don’t
like them and don’t read them”
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’ve fallen into the trap of the researchers
we discussed previously. My guess is that you asked people who were not
real prospects for the product or service featured in the ad. It’s also
possible that the ad had a poor headline, weak, uninteresting copy, or
boastful, company-centered information that didn’t connect with the reader’s
self-interest. Just because an ad has long copy does not necessarily make
it a good one.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want a truer test of what people
think about long copy ads, begin by finding out what it is they are really
interested in or passionate about, like a favourite cause, beloved hobby,
or grave concern. Now ask them if they would read a long copy ad on that
subject.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you already know the answer.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are hundreds of factors which determine
whether an ad is successful or unsuccessful. One of the factors that seems
to cause a great deal of confusion, scepticism, and debate is the use of
long copy in advertisements.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you've heard the opinion of
some of the greatest names in advertising history on the subject, I hope
that you will never again be afraid that long copy will not be read.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence is in. The results from
decades of testing and experimentation are conclusive. The logic is clear
and simple.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long copy ads work.
