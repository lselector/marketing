First, work on defining your features, benefits, USP (Unique
Selling Proposition) and irresistible offer.
<br>Next go through the list of these headlines (see below) - and try to
transform EACH AND EVERY ONE of them to your business.&nbsp; You will get
100 headlines.
<br>Then try to select several best.
<br>Then show them to your clients and 8-12 y.old children to select the
best.
<br>You can use one as a central headline - and others as sub-headlines
(or headlines to other pages, if we need them).
<br>======================================
<p>THE 100 GREATEST HEADLINES EVER WRITTEN
<p>1. THE SECRET OF MAKING PEOPLE LIKE YOU
<p>Almost $500,000 was spent profitably to run-keyed ads
<br>displaying this headline.&nbsp; It drew many hundreds of thousands
of
<br>readers into the body matter of a "people-mover"
<br>advertisement -- one which, by itself, built a big business.
<br>Pretty irresistible headline, isn't it?
<p>2. A LITTLE MISTAKE THAT COST A FARMER $3,000 A YEAR
<p>A sizable appropriation was spent successfully in
<br>farm magazines on this ad.&nbsp; Sometimes the negative idea of
<br>offsetting, reducing, or eliminating the "risk of loss" is even
<br>more attractive to the reader than the "prospect of gain."
<p>As the great business executive Chauncey Depew one
<br>said, "I would not stay up all of one night to make $100; but I
<br>would stay up all of seven nights to keep from losing it."&nbsp;&nbsp;
As
<br>Walter Norvath says in Six Successful Selling Techniques "People
<br>will fight much harder to avoid losing something they already
<br>own than to gain something of greater value that they do not
<br>own."&nbsp; It is also true that they have the feeling that losses
<br>and waste can often be more easily retrieved than new profits
<br>can be gained.
<p>What farmer could pass up reading the copy under such
<br>a headline&nbsp; to find out:&nbsp; "What was the mistake?&nbsp; Why
was it
<br>'little'?&nbsp; Am I making it?&nbsp; If it cost that farmer a loss
of
<br>$3,000 a year maybe it \rquote s costing me a lot more!&nbsp; Perhaps
<br>the copy will also tell me about other mistakes I might be
<br>making."
<p>3. ADVICE TO WIVES WHOSE HUSBANDS DON'T SAVE MONEY -- BY A WIFE
<p>The headline strength of the word "advice" has often
<br>been proven.&nbsp; Most people want it, regardless of whether or not
<br>they follow it.&nbsp; And the particular "ailment"&nbsp; referred to
is
<br>common enough to interest a lot of readers.&nbsp; The "it happened
to
<br>me" tag line, "by a Wife," increases the desire to read the
<br>copy.&nbsp; (This ad far outpulled the advertiser's previous best ad,
<br>Get Rid of Money Worries.)
<p>4. THE CHILD WHO WON THE HEARTS OF ALL
<p>This was a keyed-result ad which proved spectacularly
<br>profitable.&nbsp; It appeared in women's magazines.&nbsp; The
<br>emotional-type copy described (and the photograph portrayed) the
<br>kind of little girl any parent would want their daughter to be.
<br>Laughing, rollicking, running forward, with arms out stretched,
<br>right out of the ad and into the arms and heart of the reader.
<p>5. ARE YOU EVER TONGUE-TIED AT A PARTY?
<p>Pinpoints the myriads of self-conscious, inferiority
<br>complexed wallflowers. "That's me!&nbsp; I want to read this ad;
<br>maybe it tells me exactly what to do about it."
<p>As you go along you will notice how many of these
<br>headlines are interrogative ones.&nbsp; They ask a question to which
<p>people want to read the answer.&nbsp; They excite curiosity and
<br>interest in the body matter which follows.&nbsp; They hit home --
<br>cut through verbose indirectness.&nbsp; The best ones are challenges
<br>which are difficult to ignore, cannot be dismissed with a quick
<br>no or yes and without further reading, are pertinent and
<br>relevant to the reader.&nbsp; Note how many of the ones included here
<br>measure up to these specifications.
<p>6. HOW A NEW DISCOVERY MADE A PLAIN GIRL BEAUTIFUL
<p>Wide appeal:&nbsp; There are more plain girls than
<br>beautiful ones --&nbsp; and just about all of them want to be better
<br>looking.
<p>7. HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE
<p>This helped to sell millions of copies of the book of
<br>the same title.&nbsp; Strong basic appeal:&nbsp; We all want to do
it.
<br>But without the words "how to"&nbsp; the headline would become simply
<br>a trite wall motto.
<p>8. THE LAST 2 HOURS ARE THE LONGEST --&nbsp; AND THOSE ARE THE 2 HOURS
YOU SAVE
<p>An airline ad featured a faster jet-powered flight.
<br>Headline is a bull's-eye for air-experienced travelers who know
<br>what those last two interminable hours can do to their nerves
<br>and patience.&nbsp; Like many fine headlines, it doubtless came right
<br>out of their personal experience of its writer.&nbsp; This headline
<br>(and all the others discussed here) would have been good even if
<br>it had not been supported by any picture at all.&nbsp; But its effect
<br>was heightened by a photo of a wristwatch with the hour marks
<br>indicating one to 10 bunched together -- and 10, 11, and 12
<br>stretched wide apart.
<p>9. WHO ELSE WANTS A SCREEN STAR FIGURE?
<p>Who doesn't?&nbsp; Except men --&nbsp; and this successful and
<br>much-run ad is not addressed to them.&nbsp; "Who else"&nbsp; also has
a
<br>"get on the bandwagon"&nbsp; connotation:&nbsp; Not "Can it be done"&nbsp;
but
<br>"who else wants to have it?"
<p>10. DO YOU MAKE THESE MISTAKES IN ENGLISH?
<p>A direct challenge.&nbsp; Now read the headline back,
<br>eliminating the vital word "these." This word is the " hook"
<br>that almost forces you into the copy.&nbsp; "What are these
<br>particular mistakes?&nbsp; Do I make them?"&nbsp; Also notice (as with
<br>many of the other headlines reviewed) that this one promises to
<br>provide helpful personal information in its own context, not
<br>merely "advertising talk."
<p>The Attraction of the Specific:&nbsp; In this first
<br>breather let us stop to impress upon your mind how significant a
<br>part the "specific" plays in so many good headlines.&nbsp; It appears
<br>in many of our first 10.&nbsp; And it will appear in a surprising
<br>number of the next 90.&nbsp; You will see how magnetically it helps
<br>to draw the reader into the body matter of an advertisement.
<br>So notice, as you continue reading, how many of these headlines
<br>contain specific words or phrases that make the ad promise to
<br>tell you:&nbsp; How, Here's, These, Which, Which of These, Who, Who
<br>Else, Where, When, What, Why.&nbsp; Also note how frequently exact
<br>amounts are used:&nbsp; Number of days, evenings, hours, minutes,
<br>dollars, ways, types of.&nbsp; This "attraction of the specific"&nbsp;
is
<br>worth your special attention --&nbsp; not only as relating to words
<br>and phrases but also concerning headline ideas themselves.&nbsp; For
<br>example, compare the appeal of "We'll Help You Make More Money"
<br>with "We'll Help You Pay the Rent."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>11. WHY SOME FOODS "EXPLODE"&nbsp; IN YOUR STOMACH
<p>A provocative "why"&nbsp; headline.&nbsp; Based upon the
<br>completely understandable fact that some food combinations
<br>virtually "explode"&nbsp; in the stomach.&nbsp; Broad appeal.&nbsp;
(Relevant
<br>picture of chemical retort shaped like a stomach, starting to
<br>explode.)
<p>12. HANDS THAT LOOK LOVELIER IN 24 HOURS --&nbsp; OR YOUR MONEY BACK
<p>Universal appeal to women.&nbsp; Result guaranteed:&nbsp; "Or
<br>Your Money Back."
<br>13. YOU CAN LAUGH AT MONEY WORRIES&nbsp; -- IF YOU FOLLOW THIS SIMPLE
PLAN
<p>Something everybody wants to be able to do.&nbsp; A
<br>successful keyed ad upon which many thousands have been spent.
<p>14. WHY SOME PEOPLE ALMOST ALWAYS MAKE MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET
<p>A profitable checked-result ad selling a book written
<br>by a partner in a well-known and highly regarded brokerage
<br>house.&nbsp; Important key words:&nbsp; "some"&nbsp; and "almost"&nbsp;
--&nbsp; which
<br>make the headline credible.
<p>15. WHEN DOCTORS "FEEL ROTTEN" THIS IS WHAT THEY DO
<p>What's the secret of the success of this well-known
<br>ad?&nbsp; First:&nbsp; The suggestion of paradox.&nbsp; We seldom think
of
<br>doctors as being in poor health themselves.&nbsp; And when they are,
<br>what they do about it is information "right from the
<br>horse\rquote s mouth" carries a note of authority and greater
<br>assurance of&nbsp; "reward for reading the ad."&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the
positive
<br>promise of reward in "This Is What They Do."
<p>Also, the use of the unabashed colloquialism "feel
<br>rotten"&nbsp; gets attention; sounds human, natural.&nbsp; Besides,
it has
<br>surprise value,&nbsp; since the vocabulary of the advertising pages
<br>has a certain sameness and stilted quality.&nbsp; Many a headline
<br>fails to stop readers because its vocabulary is so hackneyed.
<br>No word or phrase in it has any attention-arresting element of
<br>surprise, no words, expressions, or ideas not commonly used or
<br>expected in the headline of an advertisement.&nbsp; This ad pulled
<br>only half the number of responses when a test was made changing
<br>"When Doctors Feel Rotten"&nbsp; to&nbsp; "When Doctors Don't Feel
Up To
<br>Par.&nbsp; (Other examples of the use of common colloquialisms and
<br>words are given, and commented upon, in many of these good
<br>headlines.)
<p>Since the idea of using headline words not commonly
<br>utilized in the lexicon of advertising is worth such serious
<br>consideration, let us cite a few more examples.&nbsp; For a book on
<br>scientific weight control:&nbsp; The one word "Potbelly"!&nbsp; (Not
very
<br>elegant, but it proved an effective stopper.)&nbsp; For a dictionary:
<br>A single word (onion, hog, shad, pelican, skunk, kangaroo, etc.)
<br>as the boldface headline of each in a series of small-space
<br>advertisements.&nbsp; You couldn't miss it on the page and you wanted
<br>to know what it was all about.&nbsp; The copy followed through by
<br>illustrating how simple and clear were the definitions in that
<br>particular dictionary.&nbsp; For a book of golf instruction: "Don't
<br>Belly-Ache About Your Golf This Year!"
<p>16. IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN OFFER THESE SIGNED
<br>ORIGINAL ETCHINGS -- FOR ONLY $5 EACH
<p>Anticipates the reader's natural incredulity
<br>concerning such an exceptional bargain.&nbsp; Thus helps to overcome
<br>his doubt in advance, by acknowledging the likelihood of it.
<p>17. FIVE FAMILIAR SKIN TROUBLES --&nbsp; WHICH DO YOU WANT TO OVERCOME?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Let me keep reading --&nbsp; to see if I have one of the
<br>five."&nbsp; The old "which of these"selling technique; not "do you
<br>want?"&nbsp; but "which do you want?"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Interrogative headline
helps
<br>entice readers into the copy.&nbsp; Note how many of these hundred
<br>are interrogative headlines.)
<p>18. WHICH OF THESE $2.50-TO-$5 BEST SELLERS DO YOU WANT -- FOR ONLY
$1 EACH?
<p>This keyed ad sold hundreds of thousands of books.
<br>Strong comparative-price bargain appeal.
<br>19. WHO EVER HEARD OF A WOMAN LOSING WEIGHT --&nbsp; AND ENJOYING
<br>3 DELICIOUS MEALS AT THE SAME TIME?
<p>Another example of a headline which anticipates
<br>incredulity in order to help overcome it.
<p>20. HOW I IMPROVED MY MEMORY IN ONE EVENING
<p>This is the famous "Addison Sims of Seattle" ad which
<br>coined that household phrase.&nbsp; Could you escape wanting to read
<br>it?
<p>21. DISCOVER THE FORTUNE THAT LIES HIDDEN IN YOUR SALARY
<p>One of those good "discover what lies hidden"
<br>headlines.&nbsp; (Note others here.)&nbsp; A proven puller for an
<br>advertiser offering sound securities on a "pay out of income"
<br>basis.
<p>22. DOCTORS PROVE 2 OUT OF 3 WOMEN CAN HAVE MORE BEAUTIFUL SKIN IN 14
DAYS
<p>Women want it.&nbsp; "Why two out of three?&nbsp; Am I one of
<br>the two?&nbsp; How have doctors proved it?&nbsp; Quick results are
what I
<br>want...Only fourteen days!"
<p>How Many Words Should a Headline Contain?
<p>You have probably often read about the desirability
<br>of having no more than a certain number of words in your
<br>headline.&nbsp; Yet, in this second breather, we want to point out
<br>that many of the headlines already quoted (and others to follow)
<br>are, by ordinary&nbsp; standards, quite long. Yet, despite their
<br>length, they were successful.
<p>Obviously, it is not wise to make a headline any lengthier than its
<br>primary function actually requires.&nbsp; However, greater-than-usual
length
<br>need not worry you...provided the headline's high spots of interest
are
<br>physically well broken up and clearly displayed --&nbsp; and provided
<br>the personal advantages promised to the reader are presented so
<br>oppositely that it is almost as though his own name appeared in
<br>the headline.
<p>Worth recounting is the story of Max Hart (ofHart, Schaffner &amp; Marx)
<br>and his advertising manager, the late and great George L. Dyer.&nbsp;
They were
<br>arguing about long copy. To clinch the argument Mr. Dyer said, "I'
ll bet you
<br>$10 I can write a newspaper page of solid types and you'd read every
word
<br>of it."&nbsp; Mr. Hart scoffed at the idea.&nbsp; "I don't have to
write a
<br>line of it to prove my point," Mr. Dyer responded.&nbsp; I'll only
<br>tell you the headline:&nbsp; "This page is all about Max Hart!"
<p>23. HOW I MADE A FORTUNE WITH A " FOOL IDEA"
<p>Paradoxes excite interest.&nbsp; Broad appeal:&nbsp; Almost
<br>everyone has once had a pet money-making idea that others have
<br>thought foolish and impractical.&nbsp; Sympathy for the underdog:
<br>"What' s the story of this man who 'turned the tables' on the
<br>people who ridiculed him?"
<p>24. HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF SAYING:&nbsp; "NO, I
<br>HAVEN'T READ IT:&nbsp; I'VE BEEN MEANING TO"?
<p>A well-known book club has spent a great deal of
<br>money on this ad.&nbsp; Headline aimed accurately at is large
<br>market-- people who "mean to"&nbsp; keep up with the new books but
<br>somehow "never get around to it."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>25. THOUSANDS HAVE THIS PRICELESS GIFT --&nbsp; BUT NEVER DISCOVER IT!
<p>"What 'priceless gift'?&nbsp; Why is it 'priceless'?
<br>If'thousands'&nbsp; have it perhaps I have it too."&nbsp;&nbsp; The
<br>"undiscovered" angle has great attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Legions of people
<br>are convinced that they possess talents and abilities which
<br>others have never discovered.&nbsp; Consequently, their world is
<br>unfortunately inclined to underrate or misjudge them.
<p>26. WHOSE FAULT WHEN CHILDREN DISOBEY?
<p>What parent wouldn't be stopped cold by this
<br>headline?&nbsp; "I'm the one who's probably to blame.&nbsp; It's a
<br>distressing condition -- and, most important, a reflection upon
<br>me.&nbsp; Maybe this ad tells me what to do about it.
<p>27. HOW A "FOOL STUNT"&nbsp; MADE ME A STAR SALESMAN
<p>What is the 'fool stunt'?&nbsp; Why did people call it
<br>that?&nbsp; How did it transform this fellow?&nbsp; I'd like to be
able to
<br>'sell' myself and my ideas --&nbsp; even though selling may not be
my
<br>vocation.&nbsp; (A large expenditure was made profitably on this ad
<br>after its result&nbsp; had been proven.)
<p>28. HAVE YOU THESE SYMPTOMS OF NERVE EXHAUSTION?
<p>Everyone likes to read about his "symptoms."&nbsp; The
<br>appeal is broad; the condition of "nerve exhaustion" is common.
<p>29. GUARANTEED TO GO THROUGH ICE, MUD, OR SNOW -- OR WE PAY THE TOW!
<p>If you offer a powerful guarantee with your product,
<br>play it up strongly and quickly in the headline.&nbsp; Don't relegate
<br>it to minor display.&nbsp; Many products are actually backed up by
<br>dramatic guarantees -- but their advertising does not make the
<br>most of them
<p>30. HAVE YOU A "WORRY" STOCK?
<p>Perhaps this ad will tell me why I need not lose any
<br>sleep over it --&nbsp; or how I can replace it with one that will
<br>zoom.
<p>31. HOW A NEW KIND OF CLAY IMPROVED MY COMPLEXION IN 30 MINUTES
<p>Promises a desirable reward for reading.&nbsp; And the
<br>true experience of another person (with something relevant to
<br>our own desires) is always interesting.
<p>32. 161 NEW WAYS TO A MAN;S HEART --&nbsp; IN THIS FASCINATING
<br>BOOK FOR COOKS
<p>Again the attraction of the specific --&nbsp; tied up with
<br>a strong basic appeal.
<p>33. PROFITS THAT LIE HIDDEN IN YOUR FARM
<p>Widely run in farm papers, with exceptional results.
<br>The hidden-profit idea and the suggestion of retrieving a loss.
<p>34. IS THE LIFE OF A CHILD WORTH $1 TO YOU?
<p>Trenchant headline for a brake-relining service.
<br>Strong emotional appeal:&nbsp; How the life of a little child may be
<br>snuffed out by an accident due to your ineffective brakes.
<p>35. EVERYWHERE WOMEN ARE RAVING ABOUT THIS AMAZING NEW SHAMPOO!
<p>The colloquial: "raving about."&nbsp; The "success"
<br>word: "everywhere."&nbsp; (The increasing popularity and sale of a
<br>product are adduced as evidence of its merit.&nbsp; "Nothing succeeds
<br>like success" ; and people love to climb on a bandwagon.)&nbsp; And
<br>the overworked "amazing" still seems to have some power left.
<p>36. DO YOU DO ANY OF THESE TEN EMBARRASSING THINGS?
<p>Bull's-eye question.&nbsp; All of us are afraid of
<br>embarrassing ourselves before others; being criticized, looked
<br>down upon, talked about.&nbsp; "Which 'ten' are they?&nbsp; Do I do
any of
<br>them?
<p>37. SIX TYPES OF INVESTORS --&nbsp; WHICH GROUP ARE YOU IN?
<p>This ad produced inquires in large quantities.
<br>Investors reviewed the characteristics of each of the six
<p>groups, as described in the ad, then inquired about a program
<br>designed to meet the investment purposes of their particular
<br>group.
<p>The Primary Viewpoint -- The "Point of You"
<p>Breather No. 3 is a short one because you already know the
<br>"lesson"&nbsp; very well.&nbsp; But to stress its importance let us
point
<br>this out to you:&nbsp; Forty three of these 100 headlines contain one
<br>of these actual words --&nbsp; " you," "your," or "yourself."&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even
<br>when the pronoun is first person singular, (for example, "How I
<br>Improved My Memory in One Evening") the reward promised is so
<br>universally desired that it is, in effect, really saying, "You
<br>can do it too!"
<p>Thousands of words have already been written
<br>about the "point of you" -- but let me remind you that, given
<br>a fountain pen, 96% of 500 college women wrote their own names;
<br>shown a map of the U.S. A., 447 men out of 500 looked first for
<br>the location of their home towns!&nbsp; Howard Barnes, of the
<br>American Newspaper Publishers'&nbsp; Association, really was on
<br>target when he said:&nbsp; "To call up an image of the reader, all
<br>you need to do is pin up a target.&nbsp; Then, starting at the
<br>outside, you can label his interests in this order:&nbsp; The world,
<br>the United States, his home state, his home town, and we' ll
<br>lump together in the black center his family and himself...me.
<br>Myself.&nbsp; I come first.&nbsp; I am the bull's-eye."
<p>38. HOW TO TAKE OUT STAINS...USE (PRODUCT NAME) AND
<br>FOLLOW THESE EASY DIRECTIONS
<p>An example of a good "service"&nbsp; ad --&nbsp; one which,
<br>besides being relevantly tied up with the product, also contains
<br>helpful information usable in itself.&nbsp; (Such ads often have
<br>considerable longevity because they are cut out and used for
<br>future reference.)
<p>39 TODAY...ADD $10,000 TO YOUR ESTATE -- FOR THE PRICE OF A NEW HAT
<p>Who wouldn' t want to do that?&nbsp; Doubt as to the
<br>promise is offset by the fact that the advertiser is a large and
<br>reputable insurance company.
<p>40. DOES YOUR CHILD EVER EMBARRASS YOU?
<p>Direct, challenging, a common circumstance.&nbsp; Brings
<br>up a flood of recollections.&nbsp; How can such unpleasant
<br>experiences be avoided in the future?&nbsp; Based upon a strong
<br>selfish appeal.&nbsp; Parents are, first, individuals;&nbsp; second,
<br>parents.&nbsp; The kind of reflection that children cast upon the
<br>prestige and self-esteem of their parents is a useful copy angle
<br>to remember.&nbsp; (This headline is the negative opposite of No. 4,
<br>The Child Who Won the Hearts of All.)
<p>41. IS YOUR HOME PICTURE-POOR?
<p>A rifle-shot question hitting thousands of readers.
<br>Illustrated by photo of an otherwise attractive living room with
<br>blank areas on its walls; with X's indicating where pictures
<br>would improve the room's appearance.
<p>42. HOW TO GIVE YOUR CHILDREN EXTRA IRON -- THESE 3 DELICIOUS WAYS
<p>It obeys the wise maxim of newspaper reporters:
<br>"Start where the reader is." In other words, the public already
<br>accepts the fact that children's blood should contain plenty of
<br>iron.&nbsp; So the headline goes on from there --&nbsp; promising "extra"
<br>iron and "3 delicious ways" to get it ("delicious"&nbsp; ways;&nbsp;
so
<br>not the common parent vs. child battle).
<p>43. TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WRITE -- BUT CAN' T GET STARTED
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Unerringly selects its audience, which is large --
<br>and stymied.
<p>44. THIS ALMOST-MAGICAL LAMP LIGHTS HIGHWAY TURNS BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM
<p>The word "almost"&nbsp; lends believability.&nbsp; Headline
<br>promises an automatic no-effort method of relieving an annoying
<br>condition or avoiding a dangerous emergency.
<p>45. THE CRIMES WE COMMIT AGAINST OUR STOMACHS
<p>Another "tart where the reader is" headline -because
<br>most people already believe they often give their digestive
<br>process some pretty rough treatment.&nbsp; This rapport, between the
<br>theme of the ad and the common belief of its readers, makes the
<br>"we"&nbsp; and "our" practically equal in effectiveness to "you"
<br>and "your."
<p>46. THE MAN WITH THE "GRASSHOPPER MIND"
<p>An immediate association with himself leaps to the
<br>mind of the reader.&nbsp; He wants to check at once on the personal
<br>parallel.&nbsp; What are the symptoms?&nbsp; Starting things one never
<br>finishes?&nbsp; Jumping from one thing to another?&nbsp; "How much
am I
<br>like him?&nbsp; It's not a good trait.&nbsp; What did he do about it?"
<br>This is an example of a negative headline that strikes home more
<br>accurately and dramatically than would a positive one.
<p>47. THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO --&nbsp; BUT WHEN I
<br>STARTED TO PLAY!
<p>Another one that has entered our language.&nbsp; Sympathy
<br>with the underdog.&nbsp; Particularly interesting, structurally, as
<br>an example of a headline which "turns the corner"&nbsp; by using a
<br>final tag line to make itself positive instead of negative.
<br>Also worth remembering:&nbsp; The before-and-after angle can be
<br>effective in many headlines.
<p>48. THROW AWAY YOUR OARS!
<p>Short and positive commands often make good stopper
<br>headlines.&nbsp; When Ole Evinrude, the outboard-motor king, ran a
<br>small ad with this headline he took the first step toward
<br>building his one-room machine shop into a big business.&nbsp; (A
<br>similar headline, Throw&nbsp; Away Your Aerial!, was also once
<br>responsible for building a business in the radio field.)&nbsp; This
<br>type of headline is worth thinking about when the product you
<br>are advertising eliminates the need for some heretofore
<br>necessary piece of equipment, some onerous job, or some sizable
<br>item of expense.
<p>49. HOW TO DO WONDERS WITH A LITTLE LAND!
<p>A successful headline which pulled 75% better than
<br>"Two Acres and Security"&nbsp; and 40% better than "A Little Land --
<br>a Lot of Living."&nbsp; The reason: "how to"&nbsp; and "do wonders
with."
<p>50. WHO ELSE WANTS LIGHTER CAKE --&nbsp; IN HALF THE MIXING TIME?
<p>Strong appeal.&nbsp; Another good "who else"&nbsp; headline.
<br>(No. 9, Who Else Wants A Screen Star Figure?)
<p>51. LITTLE LEAKS THAT KEEP MEN POOR
<p>A keyed "retrieving a loss"&nbsp; ad whose checked
<br>resultfulness justified frequent repetition.
<p>52. PIERCED BY 301 NAILS...RETAINS FULL AIR PRESSURE
<p>Who wouldn't be interested in reading more about a
<br>tire like this?
<p>53. NO MORE BACK-BREAKING GARDEN CHORES FOR ME --&nbsp; YET
<br>OURS IS NOW THE SHOW-PLACE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD!
<p>A good example of a before-and-after headline which
<br>makes the turn from negative to positive.&nbsp; Also worth noting:
<br>It has an effective element of excitement in it --&nbsp; a feature
of
<br>many good headlines, communicating the copywriter's enthusiasm
<br>to the printed page.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Don't Worry about a "Negative" Approach...
<p>This breather No. 4 is about negative headlines.&nbsp; "Accentuate the
<br>positive; eliminate the negative,"&nbsp; said a song of some years
<br>ago.&nbsp; For years that has also been the popular refrain of the
<br>advice often given to copywriters.&nbsp; Discussion about negative
<br>headlines has sometimes sparked more fire than enlightenment.
<br>Yet our 100 headlines include 21 which are completely negative
<br>and 10 others which start with a negative approach and then
<br>become positive.
<p>So the negative approach must have some good
<br>reason for existence.&nbsp; It has.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp;&nbsp; One
of the
<br>principal objectives of a headline is to strike as directly as
<br>possible right at a situation confronting the reader.&nbsp; Sometimes
<br>you can do this with greater accuracy if you use a negative
<br>headline which pinpoints his ailment rather than the alle
<br>viation of it.&nbsp; (For example, Is YOUR Home Picture-Poor? --
<br>Have YOU a "Worry" Stock? --&nbsp; Little Leaks That Keep Men Poor.)
<br>So when you face that kind of situation don't be afraid to "
<br>accentuate the negative."&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's proceed to another great
<br>headline which captured a place in our everyday language.
<p>54. OFTEN A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE
<p>So poignantly true, so pointed -- and so common.
<p>55. HOW MUCH IS "WORKER TENSION" COSTING YOUR COMPANY?
<p>An ad which was successful in business magazines
<br>reaching executives.&nbsp; "I want to know which are the kinds of
<br>'worker tension' specifically.&nbsp; What is 'worker tension' costing
<br>other companies in net profits?&nbsp; How much is it costing us?&nbsp;
If
<br>it is, what can we do about it?"
<p>56. TO MEN WHO WANT TO QUIT WORK SOMEDAY
<p>Selects its readers without wasting a word.&nbsp; (And who
<br>can say that the audience isn't kind of large?)
<p>57. HOW TO PLAN YOUR HOUSE TO SUIT YOURSELF.
<p>This pulled almost 20% better than "How to Avoid
<br>These Mistakes in Planning Your Home."&nbsp; Apparently, people
<br>expect the architect to avoid the mistakes --&nbsp; but feel that
<br>they themselves know better than anyone else what will best suit
<br>their particular needs and preferences.
<p>58 BUY NO DESK -- UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THIS SENSATION OF THE BUSINESS SHOW
<p>Strong "stopper" type of "command" headline,
<br>adaptable for many uses.&nbsp; Copy quickly follows with "until you
<br>have checked as to whether it has this feature, and this one,
<br>and this..."
<p>59. CALL BACK THESE GREAT MOMENTS AT THE OPERA
<p>Sometimes it's a good idea to "start where the reader
<br>was."&nbsp; This nostalgic headline was used to sell phonograph
<br>records of great operas.&nbsp; The idea can be used in a positive
<br>way: Tying up with a desirable remembrance.&nbsp; Or it can be used
<br>negatively: Contrasting a certain new product advantage with an
<br>undesirable remembrance.
<p>60. "I LOST MY BULGES...AND SAVED MONEY TOO"
<p>Word "bulges" is a stopper, not commonly used in
<br>advertising lexicon.&nbsp; Double-edged appeal:&nbsp; The promise to
end
<br>an unwanted condition and to save you money also.
<p>61. WHY (BRAND NAME) BULBS GIVE MORE LIGHT THIS YEAR
<p>This one illustrates an important point, one which
<br>many advertisers hate to swallow.&nbsp; It is usually not a good idea
<br>to tell the name of the company (or the brand name) in the
<br>headline --&nbsp; or to make it tell too much of the story.&nbsp; When
<p>this is done right in the headline itself it often gives the
<br>whole thing away and does not tempt the reader into the copy.
<br>However, as in this case, when the advertiser is a nationally
<br>famous company (particularly when it is noted for its
<br>enterprise, innovations, improvements, and research), the use of
<br>the company, or brand name can add news value to the headline
<br>-and help to substantiate the truth of the claim made in it.
<p>62. RIGHT AND WRONG FARMING METHODS -- AND LITTLE
<br>POINTERS THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR PROFITS
<p>Exceedingly profitable in farm papers.&nbsp; A combination
<br>of negative and positive appeals, with a lot of "come hither"
<br>for farmers.
<p>63. NEW CAKE-IMPROVER GETS YOU COMPLIMENTS GALORE!
<p>There are three things which advertising can tell its
<br>readers:&nbsp; (1) what the product is; (2) what it does; and...this
<br>headline utilizes the third (and often overlooked) one:&nbsp; In
<br>terms of&nbsp; the advertisers it is this: What other people will say
<br>of you, think of you, do for you -- how they will admire you,
<br>envy you, imitate you -- because of what my product can
<br>accomplish for you.&nbsp; In terms of the prospective customer it is
<br>this:&nbsp; Because of what your product can do for me, people may
<br>think more of me!
<p>This third factor (which is an extension of the No. 2 factor
<br>mentioned above) can be made so effective, and is so often neglected
<br>that it rates special attention here as Breather No. 5.&nbsp; The proper
<br>use of it can make advertising copy make more sales.&nbsp; Therefore,
it
<br>is worth a prominent niche in your memory.&nbsp; To keep it there,
<br>visualize a somewhat ridiculous picture.&nbsp; (Tying up an absurd
<br>pictorial association with a concept you want to remember is of
<br>course a well-known aid to memory.)&nbsp; The sketch is of a boy sitting
<br>on the prow of a PT boat.&nbsp; His mother is sit ting in the stern.
<br>Between the two the initials "PT"&nbsp; are printed in big letters
on
<br>the side of this type of small but very fast patrol boat used so
<br>extensively in World War II in the South Pacific.&nbsp; This mental
picture will
<br>help you remember the initials "BOY PT MOM."&nbsp; And these are the
<br>initials of the phrase, "Because Of You, People Think More Of
<br>Me."
<p>Headline No. 63 utilizes that factor.&nbsp; It promises the
<br>reader that this new cake improver will win her compliments from
<br>others;&nbsp; that because of you (the advertiser) other people will
<br>think more of her (the reader).&nbsp; You are offering to show her
<br>how to make what she might later call her "reputation cake."
<br>Sometimes this element in copy is called the "prestige factor,"
<br>and is considered only as an extension of the "what the product
<br>does"&nbsp; type of copy.&nbsp; (In discussing the advertising of ladies'
<br>perfumes Hal Stebbins calls it "selling the effect of the
<br>effect.")&nbsp; In the advertising of a great many products, it can
<br>be made so persuasive, so compelling, that it rates at least a
<br>subcategory of its own.
<p>64. IMAGINE ME...HOLDING AN AUDIENCE SPELLBOUND FOR 30 MINUTES
<p>A profitable narrative-ad headline.&nbsp; Broad interest
<br>in this kind of ability.&nbsp; Narrator's surprise and apparent
<br>humility lend credence and humanness to the statement.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>65. THIS IS MARIE ANTOINETTE -- RIDING TO HER DEATH
<p>An often-repeated ad for a set of books.&nbsp; It pulled
<br>eight times as many responses in 1/4-page size as were ever
<br>received from a double-spread.&nbsp; This is the only straight
<br>"curiosity"&nbsp; headline included here.&nbsp; Its headline was
<br>relevant--&nbsp; not, as so commonly used, one of those trick devices
<br>to force attention when advertising a product not closely
<br>related to the headline.
<br>66. DID YOU EVER SEE A "TELEGRAM"&nbsp; FROM YOUR HEART?
<br>A real stopper of a headline, with a great deal of
<br>lure in the copy. Top picture shows a cardiogram report printed
<br>upon a Western Union telegram form.
<p>67. NOW ANY AUTO REPAIR JOB CAN BE "DUCK SOUP"&nbsp; FOR YOU
<p>What do you know -- the words "duck soup"&nbsp; in an ad!
<br>But doesn't it tell the story in a more unusual way than would "
<br>easy,"&nbsp; "simple,"&nbsp; or some such word -- particularly to the
type
<br>of market this ad is aimed?
<p>68. NEW SHAMPOO LEAVES YOUR HAIR SMOOTHER -- EASIER TO MANAGE
<p>A result that all women want is clearly and
<br>persuasively stated.&nbsp; Word "leaves" makes it sound effortless.
<p>69. IT'S A SHAME FOR YOU NOT TO MAKE GOOD MONEY --&nbsp; WHEN
<br>THESE MEN DO IT SO EASILY
<p>The colloquial "it's a shame."&nbsp; Sympathetic
<br>understanding of the reader: "You are as capable as these other
<br>men."&nbsp; (Headline, of course, is supported by photos and good
<br>testimonials.)
<p>70. YOU NEVER SAW SUCH LETTERS AS HARRY AND I GOT ABOUT OUR PEARS
<p>Friendly, human, disarmingly ingenuous, refreshingly
<br>non-"advertisy" in language.&nbsp; And, of course, the reference to
<br>"such letters."
<p>71. THOUSANDS NOW PLAY WHO NEVER THOUGHT THEY COULD
<p>A headline perennially profitable for a large music
<br>school.&nbsp; Again, the copy is crammed with testimonials and
<br>references substantiating the claim.
<p>72. GREAT NEW DISCOVERY KILLS KITCHEN ODORS QUICK! -MAKES
<br>INDOOR AIR "COUNTRY-FRESH"
<p>The headline of an ad that launched a big business.
<br>Faces a common problem head-on; offers an easy and pleasant
<br>solution.
<p>73. MAKE THIS 1-MINUTE TEST&nbsp; --&nbsp; OF AN AMAZING NEW KIND
<br>OF SHAVING CREAM
<p>The "make this test" angle has been used in many good
<br>headlines.&nbsp; It is widely usable for others.&nbsp; Its purpose
is to
<br>induce the reader to participate in a demonstration of the
<br>product's merits.&nbsp; However, if credible and dramatic, the test
<br>can represent a persuasive demonstration whether or not the
<br>reader ever actually makes it.
<p>74. ANNOUNCING...THE NEW EDITION OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA THAT
<br>MAKES IT FUN TO LEARN THINGS
<p>The "announcement"&nbsp; type of headline (when bringing
<br>out a new product) wins attention because people are interested
<br>in new things.
<p>Neophobia? --&nbsp; Americans Don't Suffer from This Ailment!
<p>Breather No. 6 is here to remind you that in a great
<br>many of these headlines you find the word new --&nbsp; or connotation
<br>of it, such as "new kind of," "new discovery,"&nbsp; "new way to"
<br>etc.&nbsp; Americans are partial to the new or novel;&nbsp; they do
not
<br>suffer from neophobia.&nbsp; To them the mere factor of newness seems
<br>to be prima-facie evidence of&nbsp; "betterness."&nbsp; Undeviating
<br>affection for the old and tried may be strong in other
<br>countries; in ours the desire to try the new is stronger.&nbsp; The
<br>great achievements of our inventors and enterprising
<p>manufacturers have trained us to believe that if it's new it's
<br>likely to be better.&nbsp; However, the word "new"&nbsp; in a headline
<br>should be backed up by copy pointing out the merits of something
<br>really new and advantageous, not some transparently trivial
<br>difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now we come to another familiar headline...
<p>75. AGAIN SHE ORDERS..."A CHICKEN SALAD, PLEASE"
<p>You still hear it quoted.&nbsp; It sold hundreds of
<br>thousands of copies of an etiquette book because it capsulized a
<br>common and embarrassing situation.
<p>76. FOR THE WOMAN WHO IS OLDER THAN SHE LOOKS
<p>This headline was a stopper to thousands...and more
<br>successful than the subtly different "For the Woman Who Looks
<br>Younger than She Is."
<p>77. WHERE YOU CAN GO IN A GOOD USED CAR
<p>The headline of an excellent advertisement which
<br>featured what the product does -- rather than what it is. It
<br>appeared years ago, before practically everyone owned an
<br>automobile. Underneath the headline was a picture of the Indiana
<br>Sand Dunes, followed by good copy about the dunes and pointing
<br>out that "A good used car brings the whole country to you and
<br>yours.&nbsp; Why not buy one?&nbsp; You don't need a lot of money."
<br>Finally, after selling the idea, the copy gave some specific
<br>details about the cars which were for sale.
<p>78. CHECK THE KIND OF BODY YOU WANT
<p>Checklist displayed at top immediately invites
<br>reader's participation in specifying "which of these"
<br>improvements he would like to make in his physique.&nbsp; Keyed ad
<br>repeated frequently by well-known physical culturist.
<p>79. YOU KILL THAT STORY -- OR I' LL RUN YOU OUT OF THE STATE!
<p>A true narrative ad run by a nationwide chain of
<br>newspapers.&nbsp; Could you flip over the page without wanting to
<br>know what happened?
<p>80. HERE'S A QUICK WAY TO BREAK UP A COLD
<p>In simple everyday words, a direct promise to end an
<br>undesirable condition --&nbsp; quickly.
<p>81. THERE' S ANOTHER WOMAN WAITING FOR EVERY MAN -- AND
<br>SHE'S TOO SMART TO HAVE "MORNING MOUTH"
<p>Had quite an impact on women readers, this toothpaste
<br>ad.&nbsp; Obviously, for there surely is a lot of motivation in its
<br>theme:&nbsp; "No woman wants her husband to carry the memory of her
<br>morning breath to work with him. The attractive women he meets
<br>during the day don't have it."
<p>Stale News to the Advertiser May Be Fresh News to the Reader
<p>And now we come to Breather No. 7.&nbsp; Don't think
<br>that because it is our last one it is of least importance.&nbsp; In
<br>fact, its value becomes apparent when you realize how many of
<br>these headlines employ it.&nbsp; "Get news (or new value)
<br>into your headline" is probably the best way to define
<br>it.&nbsp; Since you can't pack everything into a headline,
<br>stick to your principal appeal -- but give it news value
<br>if you can.&nbsp; And remember that what may be stale news to the
<br>advertiser may be fresh news to the reader.&nbsp; The advertiser is
<br>of course thoroughly famili ar with his manufacturing methods,
<br>the ingredients he uses, the functi on of his product.&nbsp; They may
<br>have no news value for him.&nbsp; They may even be similar to those
<br>of his competitors.&nbsp; But that is not true of the readers of his
<br>advertisements.&nbsp; Something about the product or the service it
<br>renders may be entirely new and sensa tionally persuasive to the
<p>public.&nbsp; And the advertiser who features it first captures its
<br>appeal for himself, regardless of the "me-too" efforts of competitors
<br>who may have heretofore failed to capitalize upon it.
<p>82. THIS PEN "BURPS" BEFORE IT DRINKS -- BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS!
<p>Headline expressed in a few words a copy theme credited with
<br>pushing one brand of fountain pen up to a leading position.
<p>83. IF YOU WERE GIVEN $200,000 TO SPEND -- ISN'T THIS
<br>THE KIND OF (TYPE OF PRODUCT, BUT NOT BRAND NAME) YOU WOULD
<br>BUILD?
<p>A "self-incriminating" (and widely applicable) way to have
<br>the reader help to specify what he himself would value most in
<br>such a product. The copy follows through along these lines:
<br>Surely you would put this feature into it.&nbsp; You would be sure
<br>that it brought you this advantage, and this, and this...
<br>Well, we've done it all for you.&nbsp; As you can see,
<br>this product was really created for you!
<p>84. "LAST FRIDAY...WAS I SCARED! -- MY BOSS ALMOST FIRED ME!
<p>A human narrative people wanted to read because it
<br>did --&nbsp; or could -- "happen to me."
<p>85. 76 REASONS WHY IT WOULD HAVE PAID YOU TO ANSWER OUR AD
<br>A FEW MONTHS AGO
<p>An interesting example of an ad that backtracks -- pointing out in detail
<br>what the reader missed by not buying the product before.&nbsp; A
<br>frequently repeated ad used by a well-known news magazine to
<br>pull for subscriptions.
<p>86. SUPPOSE THIS HAPPENED ON YOUR WEDDING DAY!
<p>A profitable narrative-ad headline which makes it pretty hard to
<br>flip the page.&nbsp; "What was this tragic happening?&nbsp; Could it
-- or
<br>did it -- happen to me?\rdblquote \par&nbsp; \line"
<p>87. DON'T LET ATHLETE'S FOOT "LAY YOU UP."
<p>This pulled three times better than Relieve Foot Itch.&nbsp; It gives
<br>the disease a relevant name, points out unwanted effect.
<p>88. ARE THEY BEING PROMOTED RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD?
<p>Another question aimed at a big target:&nbsp; T he legion of
<br>frustrated, discouraged people who feel that their ability
<br>and conscientiousness are not being amply rewarded by recognition
<br>and advancement. (Frequently run by an educational institution
<br>which checks the resultfulness of its advertisements.)
<p>89. ARE WE A NATION OF LOW-BROWS?
<p>This headline helped to sell inexpensive editions of the
<br>classics, by the hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; It starts where the
<br>reader is -- because we, as a nation, are not reputed to be
<br>greatly addicted to the high-brow type of literature.&nbsp; Yet
<br>this successful campaign showed that Americans know very well
<br>the difference between the meritorious and meretricious --&nbsp; and,
<br>if challenged, can prove it with orders.&nbsp; The "we" angle avoids
the
<br>accusatory "you."
<p>90. A WONDERFUL TWO YEARS' TRIP AT FULL PAY --&nbsp; BUT ONLY
<br>MEN WITH IMAGINATION CAN TAKE IT
<p>This ad about a course for businessmen was repeated again and
<br>again, for a period of seven years, in a long list of magazines.
<br>It offers a worthwhile reward for reading -- with an intriguing
<br>challenge in its second line.
<p>91. WHAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO KNOW...ABOUT THIS STOCK AND BOND BUSINESS
<p>The headline of a full-page newspaper ad crammed solid with
<br>small-size type -- and nary a single picture!&nbsp; It drew 5,000 replies
<br>when first published, has since appeared in more than 150 newspapers.
<p>Promised helpful information of interest to a large audience.
<br>The ad was run by a big investment house.
<p>92. MONEY-SAVING BARGAINS FROM AMERICA'S OLDEST DIAMOND DISCOUNT HOUSE
<p>Of course the "bargain appeal" is surefire -- and this headline is a
<br>good example of straightforward presentation.
<br>93. FORMER BARBER EARNS $8,000 IN 4 MONTHS AS A REAL ESTATE SPECIALIST
<br>Featuring an actual testimonial can make a good headline.&nbsp; In
<br>this case, the reader's first reaction is "if a barber can do it
<br>maybe I can too!"
<p>94. FREE BOOK -- TELLS YOU 12 SECRETS OF BETTER LAWN CARE
<p>If you are offering something entirely free (such as a booklet or sample)
<br>-- and want requests for it in quantity -- feature it right in your
headline.
<p>95. GREATEST GOLDMINE OF EASY "THINGS-TO-MAKE"&nbsp; EVER CRAMMED
<br>INTO ONE BIG BOOK
<p>Perhaps you have anew product (or even an old one) and still
<br>lack sufficient accurate data as to which, specifically, are the
<br>strongest selling appeals to feature in your advertising.&nbsp; In
that case,
<br>it is often good strategy to "merchandise" the multipurpose "coverage"
<br>of your product as thoroughly as you can.&nbsp; By doing so, you avoid
<br>the risk of laying too much stress upon any specific appeal which
<br>may prove weak or ineffectual.&nbsp; And,&nbsp; by exposing many of
your
<br>product's uses and advantages, you at least enable your
<br>reader to know what they are -- so that he can judge for
<br>himself the ones which appeal most to him.
<p>96. $80,000 IN PRIZES!&nbsp; HELP US FIND THE NAME FOR THESE NEW KITCHENS
<p>No review of good headlines could be considered
<br>even fairly representative unless it included an example of one
<br>featuring a prize contest.&nbsp; Of course, it first boldly displays
<br>how much money can be won; secondly, what you have to do to win
<br>some of it.
<p>97.&nbsp; NOW!&nbsp; OWN FLORIDA LAND THIS EASY WAY...$10 DOWN AND $10
A MONTH
<p>This one also represents a commonly used headline offer -- easy
<br>terms -- and conveys it forcefully and persuasively.
<p>98. TAKE ANY 3 OF THESE KITCHEN APPLIANCES -- FOR ONLY $8.95
<br>(VALUES UP TO $15.45)
<p>The familiar reduced-price offer which we see in so many
<br>different and alluring forms.
<p>99. SAVE $.20 ON 2 CANS OF CRANBERRY SAUCE -- LIMITED OFFER
<p>An example of the ever-popular coupon-redemption offer.
<br>"Limited offer\" to increase response.&nbsp; (Sometimes an actual
<br>expiration date is stated, to spur quicker action.)
<p>100. ONE PLACE-SETTING FREE FOR EVERY THREE YOU BUY!
<p>So now we've finished running the hundred -- except for this
<br>last type of headline:&nbsp; The ubiquitous free offer.&nbsp; The rules
specify
<br>(as exemplified here) that when something must also be bought; this
<br>requirement must be displayed with sufficient prominence.
<br>"Free"&nbsp; is of course a hackneyed and moss-covered word, but there
<br>doesn't seem to be any equally strong or less blatant substitute for
it.
