How to Make Maximum MoneyIn Minimum Time

IMPORTANT!

READ THIS FIRST!

Dear Friend,

Your decision to purchase this manual is probably going to turn out to be the smartest move
you've ever made!

As you are about to learn, this manual totally delivers on every promise I've made in my
advertising. Not only that, every profit-making idea you are about to read has already been
tested and proven to work. These ideas have already generated tens of millions of dollars in
revenues for myself, my clients and that very select group of people who subscribe to my
newsletter.

Consider this: The simple secrets you will learn in Section One have generated more than
$58,000,000 in gross sales for Halbert's Incorporated in Bath, Ohio!

And this: The co-venture financing data in Section Three can help you get all the money you
need to finance the "roll out" of your tested marketing ideas... and, you can get this money
without borrowing!

And this: The secrets revealed in Section Five are the very same ones I used to help Ernest
Borgnine and his wife Tova multiply the sales of their cosmetic company by more than 1200%
in just 8 months!

And this: The secrets revealed in Section Nine will enable you to mail hundreds of thousands of
sales letters... at no cost whatsoever!


And this: The secrets in the other 12 sections should remove almost every single roadblock

Now listen: Somewhere along the line, you're going to realize that the info in this manual is
worth thousands and you're going to start wondering why I'm revealing all these inside secrets

The reason is rather interesting. You see, I publish a newsletter that goes out to people all over
the world and sells for $195.00 per year. And guess what? In spite of that high price, almost
everybody who gets my newsletter decides to renew their subscription and many of my
subscribers end up doing business with me!

Why? Simply because my newsletter delivers more real "hard-core" money-making secrets
than any other publication on Earth!

However, a person has to read my newsletter before he can tell how valuable it is and not
everybody is willing to pay $195.00 unless they have already read a few issues. Therefore, I
have decided to include some of the material from a few of my back issues in this manual so
you can discover for yourself just how good my newsletter really is. And then, after you've
read the rest of this manual, you'll learn in Section 16, how to subscribe to the Gary Halbert

SECTION #1
This material was extracted from the 9/1/86 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

The Amazing Direct Mail SecretOf A Desperate Nerd From Ohio!

I first got bitten by the mail order bug in the mid-1960's. What really got me fired up was reading
a little set of booklets called "The Direct Mail Guides" written by a man named Thomas Hall. Those
guides were terrific. They remain, to this day, the very best material I've ever read on the subject
of direct mail.

In any case, those guides were my original inspiration and, later, I became even more excited
when I read an article in The Reporter of Direct Mail about a man named John Leslie who had a
company called Leslie Creations and later, another company called "Mail Order Methods."

To me, Leslie and Thomas Hall were heroes. They were clear-headed doers who were successful in
the most exciting, romantic business on earth: mail order. They had money, an exciting life style
(Leslie even had two refrigerators: one just for soft drinks!), recognition of their peers, and
everything else a man could want. I longed to be just like them.

So I started to study. Hard.

I read everything I could get my hands on about advertising, direct mail and mail order. I mean
everything. If my local library or bookstore didn't have a marketing book I wanted, I would drive
hundreds of miles to get it. I even flew to New York (I was living in Ohio at the time) to check out
the Manhattan Public Library, and to Washington D.C. to forage through the Library of Congress.

Let me tell you: I was driven. I read it all. I was voracious. I went on a reading frenzy with the
same passion a Great White goes on a feeding frenzy. I memorized all the rules, AIDA, IDCA, PPPP
and so on. I learned, from my reading, that hundreds of split-run tests over the years had proven
the following:

* It is more cost effective to use bulk rate than first class postage.


* Teaser copy on the outer envelope always increases response.

* A two-color letterhead is better than only one color.

* The best direct mail package always contains (in addition to an outer envelope with
teaser copy all over it and a two-color sales letter), a four-color brochure, a business
reply envelope and a printed order card.

This was gospel. After all, all the books said the same thing. Those books also said it was almost
impossible to make a compiled list work and that you should never, ever try to make a mailing to
names from a telephone book.

Who was I to argue? This stuff was all "proven".

And so, armed with the results of all this "proven" research, I set out to make my fortune in direct
mail.

Back then, my life settled into a routine and it went like this: I would come up with a product idea
like a book or a report or something and, then, following all the rules, I would create a direct mail
package to sell that product. After that, I would then, beg, steal or borrow enough money to get
my envelopes, letters, brochures and everything else printed up and then, (to save money), my
wife and I would stuff the letters and stamp and seal them ourselves and put them in the mail.
Then, of course, we'd sit back to wait for the money to roll in.

It never came. Not very much anyway.

And so, I'd start over. I'd find or conceptualize another product and I'd go at it once again. I was
so obsessed in those days that, if necessary, I would literally spend the utility money to make my
test mailings. Sometimes my wife and I would be anxiously waiting for the orders to come while
sitting in a dark house with no water because we hadn't paid our utility bills.

True.

This got to be very tiresome. Especially for Nancy. She was remarkably firm, after awhile, on the
idea that we should not let our water be turned off just so we could mail another test. Can you
imagine that? I mean really; how narrow- minded can a person be? Is it any wonder we eventually
got a divorce?

So anyway, after about three years (I'm sometimes a slow learner) of this dreary existence, I sat
down and did some thinking. I said to myself something like this:

"Gary, what would you do if you had to make your next mailing work? What
if you could only mail one letter and, if you didn't get a response, you would,
quite literally, be beheaded?"

Try thinking like that sometime....like your life actually depends on the success of your next
mailing. Can you do it? Can you put yourself in that frame of mind? Well, I did, and I came to a


number of conclusions, and I want you to reason along with me.

Now listen, if, for real, you had to mail one letter to a stranger and you had to get an order from
him or you really would be murdered, here is the way I think you would be thinking:

First, I bet you would NOT mail bulk! Certainly not if your life depended on it. Would you? I sure
wouldn't for at least three reasons:

1. If the stranger I was writing to had moved, my bulk rate letter would NOT be
forwarded to him and, if my life really was on the line, I sure wouldn't chance non-
delivery. Would you?

2. Secondly, if I mailed bulk rate and my letter did get delivered, I would be scared
to death that maybe the stranger to whom I was writing would see it was bulk rate
and maybe not open it because maybe he was very busy and maybe not feel like
taking the time to open anything except his personal mail.

That's way too many maybes for me.

3. Thirdly, even back then, I had a sneaking suspicion that sometimes postal workers
would throw away bulk rate mail because they were too tired or too lazy to lug it
around and they knew nobody would miss it!

And so, my friend, for those three reasons, I decided to mail my "life or death" letter via first class
mail.

But wait. Since my life was on the line, I also wanted to make sure my recipient knew it was first
class mail. In other words, I wouldn't risk confusing him by using metered mail or a first class
printed indicia. No. Absolutely not. Since my life depended on getting that letter opened, I decided
I would use a real, honest-to-God, live postage stamp!

By the way, have you ever seen any of those stupid direct mail packages that use first class
postage that is cleverly disguised to look like bulk?

Enough about postage. The next thing that occurred to me is that I would not put a label on my
carrier envelopes. Certainly not if my life depended on it. No. What I would do, instead, is type or
hand-write my stranger's name and address on that envelope because I would want him to accept
my letter as a personal communication.

O.K., what else? Well, I decided I wouldn't put any teaser copy on the envelope either. I mean,
honestly, would you risk your life on getting a response from a letter mailed to a stranger if the
outside envelope said:

"Here's how to get TIME magazine at half price!"

I wouldn't.


What would I write on the envelope? Well, I decided my best bet would be to write something like
"URGENT" or "FIRST CLASS MAIL" or else maybe write nothing at all.

And what about the corner card? Should it reveal that my letter was from TIME-LIFE BOOKS or
THE AJAX WIDGET COMPANY or HALBERT'S MAIL ORDER GADGETS?

Not on your life.

Not on mine, anyway! No, sir. If, quite literally, my life depended on it, my letter was going to
arrive in a plain white personal-looking envelope with a real live, honest-to-God, first-class
postage stamp, a typed or handwritten address, no teaser copy, and a corner card that revealed
only (and very discreetly) the sender's return address.

Doesn't sound very impressive, does it?

Stay with me. You are reading the evolutionary process of some original conceptual thinking that
has resulted in gross sales of untold hundreds of millions of dollars.

Onward.

So much for the envelope. So far, I had done everything I could (short of mailing by registered or
certified mail) to get my letter delivered and accepted as a piece of personal mail and, therefore, I
had done what I could to achieve the primary and most important thing in all of Direct Mail Land
which is:

I GOT MY ENVELOPE DELIVERED

and

I GOT IT OPENED!

What's that? Are you thinking "what's the big deal?" Listen my friend, as simple as this sounds,
the Number One reason for the financial failure of most direct mail is because:

IT NEVER GETS DELIVERED and/or NEVER GETS OPENED!

Really. Aside from making the wrong offer to the wrong list, not getting your letter delivered or
opened is the Numero Uno mistake. Think about it: What does it matter how sparkling your copy,
how compelling your offer, or how attractive your price if your intended recipient never receives
(or opens) your letter? You know, this simple truth seems to me to be so self-evident that I feel a
bit silly being so redundant about it. But, you know what? I'd rather be redundant than bankrupt
and bankrupt is where a lot of mailers have wound up because of failure to grasp this simple and
"obvious" concept.

More about that later. But now, let's say we've got our letter opened so what else is there to worry
about?


Hmm. Let's see. Well, what about this? What if my prospect opens what he thinks is a piece of
personal mail and then, all of a sudden, he finds out it's not...because he sees a color brochure, a
printed order card, a BRE, a rabbit's foot and some kind of YES-NO "hot potato"?

No good. Certainly not if my life depended on getting a response. No good at all. There's just no
way I would be willing to risk having my guy open what he thought was a personal letter and then
see all that stuff and go, "Oh, yuk!"

Nope. You know what I decided I would want him to see when he opened that letter? Actually, it's
so unusual I'll bet you'll never guess. And, unless you're very broad-minded, you'll probably never
forgive me for this kind of anarchistic thinking. Because... what I decided I wanted my guy to see
when he opened that envelope was a (gulp!)...a...a...a...

A LETTER!

Yes. I wanted him to see what was, or at least appeared to be, a real, honest-to-God personal
letter.

And nothing else.

And so, my very first "life or death" mailing contained only two elements: the rather plain
envelope I've already described and a simple one-page (361 words) letter that had the
appearance of a personally typed letter.

Did it work?

I'd say so. That letter generated 7,300,000 cash-with-order customers and was the wellspring that
built a mail order company, (Halberts) that eventually employed more than 700 people, 40 of
whom were needed just to make our bank deposits which often consisted of some 20,000 checks
per day.

Now listen. My thinking on what a direct mail package should contain has changed over the years.
For one thing, I have learned how to achieve that same effect (or, at least a similar effect) by
using bulk rate stamps and now, I usually include a reply envelope and, most always, an order
form (I hide it, though).

In any case, what you have just read is the evolutionary process of how I developed my A-pile, B-
pile concept and I am including a more precise and formal, up-to-date explanation of that concept
on the next few pages of this letter. If you create direct mail yourself, what I suggest you do is
put those particular pages in a file someplace and re-read them every time you are about to
design another mailing. And, if you pay other people to create direct mail for you, I suggest you
photocopy (just this once, you have my permission) those pages and give them to your creative
person and tell him/her to consider the concepts contained therein before your next piece is
created.

Onward.

The A-Pile


vs.

The B-Pile

Are you ready to get started? Good. You are now about to learn the most important thing you will
ever learn on the subject of direct mail. I have a similar lesson to teach you about newspaper and
magazine advertising, but that will come later in another letter. Right now, we will talk only about
direct mail.

Whatever. Professor Halbert is now going to give you his semi-famous A-pile, B-pile lecture. It
goes like this: Everybody in the world divides his mail into two piles which I call the A-pile and the
B-pile. The A-pile contains letters that are, (or appear to be), personal. The B-pile contains
everything else: bills, catalogs, brochures, printed announcements, envelopes that obviously
contain a sales message, and so on.

Now listen up: The most important thing you can ever do when creating a direct mail promotion is
to make sure your letter gets in the A-pile!

Here's why. Everybody always opens all of their A-pile mail and only some of their B-pile mail.

It's as simple as that. And when you are spending thousands (and sometimes millions) of dollars
to mail a sales message, you want to make damn sure that everybody who receives your letter
will at least open the envelope. You know, this simple truth seems to me to be so self-evident that
I am always amazed when someone wants to argue with me about it. And, usually, as you might
expect, the most vigorous arguments come from the most "experienced" advertising people.
These people just love to tell me how they always found that B-pile direct mail is more cost
effective.

They are always wrong. You see, they may have sent a personal looking envelope but usually, as
I'll explain later, they forget to eliminate the "Oh Yuk!" reaction. But first, let's talk about the
differences in the appearance of an A- pile envelope as opposed to an envelope that is destined to
wind up in the B-pile.

It's really quite simple. You see, A-pile envelopes always look personal. Not necessarily personal
like they came from your Aunt Minnie but, at least, personal like they were a communication from
one real person to another real person. The best (most cost-effective) A-pile envelopes always
have a live postage stamp affixed. They never have teaser copy. They never immediately reveal
by the corner card that the material inside contains a commercial message. They are never
addressed by label and they are seldom oversized or odd shaped.

Want an example? If so, just look at the envelope that this letter came in. It's a plain white #10
with a typewritten address, a first-class postage stamp and a corner card that reveals only the
name and address of the sender.

Down with awards for graphic design;

up with response!


Now let's talk about B-pile envelopes. What do they look like? You already know. You've seen
thousands of them. They are usually label addressed and they contain teaser copy, award winning
graphics, photographs, YES-NO windows, windows with a fake check showing through, "Miami Vice
Colors", a printed bulk rate indicia or else a printed first-class indicia (the stupidest mistake in
direct mail), tear strips, and any and everything else a misinformed direct mail "expert" can think
of that will (he thinks) help get his envelope opened.

It's so sad.

Now bear with me. I want you to imagine, in your mind's eye, that a very busy man (or woman) is
going to his mailbox and there, lo and behold, he finds a double handful of B-pile mail. Can you
see it? Can you see that unbelievable "collection of creativity"? Can you see all those pastel
colored window envelopes? See the one that says "Free Oxygen to Everyone Who Breathes"?
Can you see the one that says "The Most Important Collection Of Books Ever Offered by
TIME-LIFE"? Can you see the one that has (oh boy!) three windows)? Can you see that fat one
that contains enough printed material to make up the first volume of the Encyclopedia
Brittanica? (come to think of it, that one did come from the Brittanica) Can you see the one
that has a photo of a starving child begging for food? Can you see the one that some idiot tried to
personalize by computer printing (on the envelope!) some cute little message that says, "Here's
good news for the Halbert family and everybody else who lives close to 8033 Sunset
Boulevard!"?

Just look at that mess!

Can you guess what happens when a busy man (or woman) goes to his mailbox and finds such a
collection? What is the first thing he will do with all this stuff? Go ahead and guess. I bet you get it
wrong.

O.K., let's find out. Did you guess that the first thing a person will do with all this stuff is throw it
away? If you did, you are wrong. You see, the first thing a person will do with it is sort through it
to see if he has received any A-pile mail.

After that, then he throws it away!

Now, before I go on, I want to admit that he will not always throw all of it away. If he happens to
spot an envelope that catches his eye and, if he happens, at that very moment, to be just dying to
buy another magazine subscription or self-help book, or, if he has just been going crazy waiting
for a piece of mail from the Columbia Record Club then maybe, just maybe, he will open one of
these envelopes and see what it is all about.

But don't count on it. The percentages are against you.

O.K., if getting your letter into the A-pile is the most important thing you can do, what is the next
most important thing you can do? The answer is simple. The next most important thing is to make
sure your letter stays in the A-pile.

Here's what I mean. Suppose your prospective customer gets an envelope that looks like one of


the A-pile envelopes (like the one this letter came in) that I have already described. Listen: There
is no doubt that such an envelope will be opened. It looks personal, it has a first class stamp, it
does not obviously contain a sales message and, all in all, it is an excellent example of a personal
looking envelope. However, what happens when he does open the envelope and he finds a bunch
of material that looks like the creation of it has set up some graphic artist for life (not to mention
his sleazebag brother-in-law who owns a printing business)?

You know what I'm talking about, don't you? I'm talking about the big colorful brochures, YES-NO
tokens, lurid, oversized order forms, ingenious award winning "hot potatoes", whistles, bells,
kazoos, and a personal message from President Reagan.

What will happen? I'm sure you already know: What will happen is that our prospect will say, "Oh,
yuck!" and, most likely, he will now throw the promotion away!

No good. Here is a better way. I want you to imagine what will happen when your prospect opens
the A-pile envelope and, instead of seeing "Graphics on Parade," he sees what appears to be a
simple, typed letter and another envelope that is plain, white and sealed and has typed on it:

"Please open this envelope

as soon as you have read my letter.

Thanks. GH"

What will happen? It's easy to figure out. Your prospect will begin reading the letter to find out
what this is all about. And then, if you are skillful enough, your letter will grab your prospect's
attention, it will hold his interest, it will whet his appetite for your goods or services and then, at
the end, it will refer him to the sealed envelope and tell him to open it for more information and
descriptive literature.

And what will he find when he opens the sealed envelope? Nothing special, really. You see, what
he will find is all the same stuff (order card, brochure, reply envelope, etc.) that was in many of
the B-pile packages I have previously described.

But what is different, what is so very different, is when he was exposed to this material. It's a
matter of timing. Selling is like seduction. If you ask a woman to go to bed with you, whether or
not she says "yes" is largely a matter of when you ask her. If you ask her immediately, as soon as
you've been introduced, most likely she will think you are a creep and tell you to get lost.
However, if you wait a while, wait until she gets to know you a little, wait until you've wined and
dined her a few times, wait until she's had a chance to warm up to you, to discover that you are,
indeed, a fine fellow, then, my friend, your chances of getting a "yes" for an answer are much,
much better.

So it is with selling. Any kind of selling. It doesn't matter if it is door- to-door, direct mail,
television, radio, newspaper ads or whatever; if you take the trouble to warm up your prospect, to
seduce him a little before you pop the big question ("will you buy my goods?"), then your closing
rate will be much, much higher.


DON'T BE A MASOCHIST!

I know, I know. There's an old joke about a guy who immediately asks every woman he meets to
go to bed with him and, when his friends ask him if he doesn't get slapped a lot, he replies, "Sure
I do, but I get lucky a lot, too!"

Well, in my opinion, that guy is much more of a masochist that he needs to be. You don't have to
go around getting slapped all the time in order to get a little romance in your life and, in direct
mail, you don't have to settle for the high rate of rejections to sales that most promotions get.

A MILLION DOLLAR EXAMPLE!

Look: Here is a true story that will illustrate my point. Not long ago, I was asked to go to Las
Vegas to help a guy who was in trouble. The guy was a nephew of Colonel Sanders, and he had
inherited a lot of Colonel Chicken's money and he had invested it in a lot of high-priced vitamins
he was unable to sell. The vitamins were stored in a warehouse and he and his partners wanted to
know if I could figure out a way to sell them by mail.

I wasn't very interested. I was very, very interested, however, in a certain promotion that was
being mailed by one of the men at that meeting, and I told this man I would like to redo his
mailing piece for him.

He wasn't interested. He said his mailing was already working. He said he was mailing between
300,000 and 1,200,000 letters every month and that he was making a good profit.

You know what I told him? I told him his mailing was working in spite of how horrible it was. I told
him that he had obviously discovered an appeal that was so "right on target" to the people he was
mailing to that even a really terribly conceived mailing piece would work. I also told him that if he
would let me redo his mailing package and give it the A-pile treatment, that he would hardly be
able to believe the results.

He agreed to let me try. He wrote me a big deposit check (I love that part!) and we made a deal.
Then I got back on the plane and flew back to L.A. and, before the wheels touched down, only 45
minutes later, I was finished. I hardly rewrote the promotion at all; I just cleaned it up a little so it
flowed a little more smoothly. But, of course, the main thing I did was reformat his promotion. I
made sure his envelope looked personal so it would get into the A-pile and I made sure that when
the envelope was opened that the promotion still had an A-pile look and that the prospect would
be sure to, at least, begin to read the sales letter.

So what were the results? Does this stuff really work or is it all theory?

None of this is theory. Everything I have told you has been proven by careful testing. What has
happened in this case is that promotion, (using the same sales pitch and almost the exact same
words), is pulling in approximately $96,000.00 more every month.

That's over one million extra dollars per year in return for 45 minutes' work.

Case closed. End of lecture.


Onward. Thank you for reading that last section. And now, with your permission, I shall continue.
Let us go back to where I was earlier in this letter before I subjected you to my A-pile, B-pile
lecture. As you will recall, I was flat broke trying to reason with a pig-headed wife who considered
running water and electricity more important than making another direct mail test. So much for
her. In any case, after I figured out that my "life or death" letter should at least "look" personal, I
decided it would be just wonderful if, somehow, I could give my sales letters the appearance of
having actually been individually typed and that's when I figured out:

How To Make

A Fake Computer Letter!

Please pay attention; this is going to be fun reading! O.K., now back in those days, computer
letters were just starting to catch the attention of the direct marketing community. The first ones
were just awful. All the letters were in upper case type and they looked more like a
DECLARATION OF WAR than a personal letter. But then, a bit later, a genius named Leo Yochim
got hold of the first upper and lower case IBM print chain and started messaging computer
programs in such a way as to eventually develop a computer letter that looked a lot like a real
typed letter.

And guess what? Those first computer letters would, on the average, increase response by 300%!

But there was a catch. Actually, there were two catches. One was that very few people knew how
to create those computer letters and the other was that it cost a fortune to do the programming
and generate the letters.

This did not bode well for a nerd (me) who couldn't even pay his utility bills.

Now remember, my frame of mind back then was that I was going to create a "do- or-die" direct
mail package and that concept does not lend itself well to a letter that begins "Dear Sir" or "Dear
Occupant" or "Dear Resident."

So one fine day, I found myself reading a newspaper story that changed my entire life. It was
about a little old lady who had found a neat way to supplement her social security income. What
she would do is go to her local library and pick out a surname and then do some research and find
out if there was ever a coat-of-arms (family crest) that was recorded with that name.

Then, if there was, she would make a black and white drawing of it and have that drawing printed
on a postcard. Then she would mail her postcard to everybody who had that surname who lived in
her county. The postcard would say she had discovered that a coat-of-arms had been recorded
with the recipient's name and that this is what the design looked like in black and white. She also
went on to say that the coat-of-arms was even more dramatic in color and would offer to hand
paint one for the reader for a relatively modest fee.

BINGO!

Oh, wow! My mind started racing. "Look," I said to myself. "Gary, here is a way to make FAKE


computer letters! What I'll do is get a bunch of telephone books from a bunch of big cities and
then I'll pull out all the Andersons and Bakers and Halberts and so on, and then I'll type one letter
that starts out 'Dear Mr. Anderson,' and then I'll weave in that name all throughout the copy."

And I did, and it worked!

I started out with phone books, but later, after I had a little money, my partner (Dennis Haslinger)
and I made an arrangement with Reuben Donnelly in Oak Park, Illinois (Bob Harter was our rep
back then; I wonder whatever happened to him?) and here's what we had Donnelly do: We had
them computer pass their entire file (that cost about $70,000 back then) and put all those names
into alphabetical order. By the way, you know what is ironic? They had just taken them OUT of
alphabetical order because of the new postal regulations that required you to keep your list in ZIP
order!

Anyway, once the file was in alphabetical order, we'd have them kick out 20 surnames or so and
have them address envelopes to all those names and keep each pile of envelopes addressed with
certain surnames separate from the other "surname piles."

Let's say one of the names was Anderson. O.K., what we'd do is we'd type one "Anderson letter"
and then have it offset printed, and then we would have a thousand or so FAKE computer letters.

And of course, we'd then insert all those "Anderson letters" into the "Anderson envelopes" and
mail them out, and then we took in

MILLIONS and MILLIONS and

MILLIONS and MILLIONS and

MILLIONS of dollars!

And ever since, good old semi-handsome Gary has been able to pay his utility bills.

SECTION #2
This section contains the complete text of the
12/5/87 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

How To Get A Product To SellIf You Don’t Have One AlreadyAnd How To Get It For Nothing!

Sometimes (in fact, often), in the press and crush of business, I forget my manners. There's no
excuse for the delay but, herewith, I would like to offer public and belated thanks to: Gary
Bencivenga for sending me a copy of Obvious Adams, Lee Rogers for the Thomas Hall Report on
writing a sales letter, Dan Kennedy for the tapes on public speaking, G. Lee Roberts for a couple
of the actual "Little Blue Books," and Frank Cawood for a magnificent bronze eagle.

Not to mention the legions of people who've written me nice letters.

Bless you all.

Also, before I get going this month, I'd like to answer a question here in print I am often asked by
phone or letter. The question is: "Do you ever do any public speaking and what do you charge?"
The answer is yes. I do quite a bit of public speaking and I do not charge a fee. What I do is I ask
the sponsoring organization to pay my expenses (airfare and hotel) and to write a check, no
matter how small, to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. I also ask that arrangements be made
for my talk to be recorded and I want it understood that I own the rights to the recorded material.

All in all, I'm a rather cheap date.

Now, let's get down to business. Most of you who read this newsletter already know a great deal
about selling via direct response. Now, let us suppose a newcomer comes to you and wants to
know the single most important thing he could ever learn about this noble field of endeavor.

What would you tell that person? What, in your opinion, is the very most important consideration


of all when it comes to selling via direct response? Or, for that matter, any form of selling? What
should be the "cornerstone concept" of all our efforts? What is the one thing we can do that will
dramatically energize all our efforts, keep us perpetually enthused, insure our unflagging interest,
help us overcome all obstacles and objections and keep us smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
all the time?

Is there a single principle that's that critical? A stand alone consideration that is truly supreme
above all others? You bet there is. And, I can communicate it to you in just four words:

SELL SOMETHING YOU LOVE!

Listen up: I get calls all the time from people asking for marketing help. I like getting those calls. I
like helping people. I like showing off how smart I am. And I love all the cards and letters I get
from people who've used my advice with enormous success. Like this one which just came in
which says in part:

"I took your first $1.00 letter, changed it around to the copy enclosed, and mailed it
out to about 600 of my "best" clients. The only difference is that I sent a $2.00 bill
instead of a one. Those 600 letters took in a little over 100 grand."

Think about it: one hundred thousand dollars from only 600 letters!

Now, the man who wrote that letter has a lot going for him. He's smart, he listens to other smart
people (like me), he tests, he's willing to experiment, he's got a lot of marketing savvy but, most
of all. . .

HE LOVES HIS PRODUCTS!

His name is Fred Rowe. He sells quality gemstones and because of his genuine enthusiasm for his
wares, he maintains a non-stop effervescence that transmits itself to all his customers.

And so, because of all this, and because it fits into the context of what I'm trying to teach you this
month, I've decided to give him a free plug which he really doesn't need. Therefore, if you are in
the market for a diamond, a ruby, a red spinel (my favorite) or any other type of gemstone, I
recommend you give him a call at

(270) 338-2363.

But, of course, not everyone who asks me for help gets the same response. Sadly, quite a few of
my calls are from people who are trying to sell something that sucks. A case in point: Recently, I
got a call from a guy who's having trouble selling his little report on making extra money.

"Does it work?" I ask. "Do the people who buy your report get a good deal? Does it really help
them make a lot of extra money?"

"Not really," says the caller. "It's basically just a bunch of hot air; just something I threw together
because I know there's a market for this work at home stuff."


Well, at this point, I lose interest. Why should I care about this nickel-dime scammer and his
dreary little report?

How pathetic.

Now, if you are ever going to listen to me about anything, please, please listen to this:

NO ONE CAN EVER BE A

SUCCESS WHO SELLS SOMETHING

OF WHICH HE IS NOT PROUD!

Oh yeah, I know you know there are plenty of people who make plenty of money selling crap. So
what? Money is only one (and truly not the most important) of all the ingredients that make
someone a success. And making money (even millions) while losing your self- respect leads to a
dry rot of the psyche and a constant patina of despair that dulls the fabric of your life.

What's that? You say I've babbled on enough about this? That you didn't subscribe to this letter
for a lecture on integrity? You say you want me to get on with it and say something practical?

Alright. Alright. How about this? How about if I teach you how to create a damn near perfect
product? Something you can sell for 20 times or more what you pay for it and still be giving full
value? Something that's going to be so useful and so worthwhile your head will swell with pride
and your wallet will swell with money? Not only that, this product is so wondrous that, if you
already have a good product, this product will make your already good product even better.

And, more saleable.

In other words, what we're going to do here is create a product that will stand alone all by itself or
else can be used to pump up the value of what you've already got.

Let's get started. Step numero uno is to make a rather comprehensive list of all the stuff you
already enjoy. If I were to make such a list, an abbreviated version of it would include:

Self-Aggrandizement Skiing

Public Speaking

Browsing in bookstores

Playing with my Scuba Diving

Two new kittens

Buying surprise gifts


Writing my newsletter for Paulette

Daydreaming Messing around with my boat (I just bought the original Admiring myself in dive
boat from the old TV the mirror series SEAHUNT starring Lloyd Bridges.)

Watching my kids get excited about something.

Producing TV shows (It seems my son, Kevin, produced my first one Friday has really taken to
before last and I loved it.)

etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

Now, what you should do is make the same kind of list and make it very, very comprehensive.
Take some time with this. This isn't some fatuous exercise. No. This is the critical first step to
what can become an enormous marketing success!

O.K., now assuming you've made your list and reviewed it a couple of times, the next step is to
take a trip down to your local library. I want you to ask at the reference desk for the following
publications: The Standard Periodical Directory published by Oxbridge Communications Inc., in
NYC, the SRDS List Book and SRDS Business Publications which comes in three volumes: Part
I (trade magazines), Part II (classified), Part III (International Direct Response - mostly postcard
decks), and the SRDS Consumer Magazine Book.

Now, compare your list of stuff you love with the classifications and indexes in all these books.
What we're trying to find out here is a rough idea of how many other people share one or more of
your passions.

What you're going to find is there is no readily assessable market that coincides with some of the
stuff you love but there are scads of folks who share your enthusiasm for some of the other
activities on your list. Let's say, for example, that you are just crazy about collecting antique
sewing machines. Well, my friend, in this case you're going to find you are pretty much alone with
this particular enthusiasm. On the other hand, if you, like me, like to ski, you're going to find that
there are tons of other folks who share your interest. For example, a rather cursory examination
of the above-mentioned reference works reveals the following:

Mailing Lists Available

1. Ski Dazzle Mailing List: Attendees at the Los Angeles Ski Show: All California
names. Total available: 39,128.

2. Skiers by Age and Income: Buyers who completed a questionnaire stating their
interest in skiing and giving information on their demographics and other lifestyle
indicators. Selections available: sex, occupation, marital status, home ownership,
credit card usage and ages of children at home. Total available: 2,640,622.

3. Skiing Enthusiasts: This one's from Donnelly Marketing, the big compiler. Total


available: 514,148.

Publications Devoted to Skiing

Name Circulation

1. Ski Business 14,432

2. Skiing Trade News 11,781

3. Ski Magazine 440,083

4. Ski America 400,000

5. Ski X-C 160,000

6. Skier Directory 160,000

7. Skiing 440,537

8. Skiing Utah 100,000

9. Ski Area Management 3,624

10. Ski B.C. (British Columbia) 75,000

11. Ski Competition East 7,500

12. Ski Industry Bulletin 12,000

13. Ski Pro (No circ. given)

14. Ski Quebec (No circ. given)

15. Ski Shop Bible Industry Guide (No circ. given)

And on and on and on. There's Ski Trails, Ski World, Skier of California, Skier's Advocate, Skiing in
Europe, Sno-times, Southwest Skier, Student Skier, Sugarloaf Magazine and so forth, et cetera.

We have now done two very important things: (1) we have identified an area for which you have
passion, and (2) we have verified that you have access to millions of other people who share your
enthusiasm.

Sounds like a setup to me.


Onward to step #3. Hopefully, by now, I've got you wondering if it would make any sense for you
to sell something that relates to skiing which interests you, as opposed to your current endeavor
of trying to sell manure to the masses or whatever else you are doing that's boring you to tears.

Assuming all this makes sense to you, what in the world should you sell to all these people
interested in skiing? Should you invent a new type of ski boot? Should you open a ski lodge? How
about manufacturing ski clothing?

Whoa! You're making it too hard. Let's sell something else. Something easy. Something cheap.
Something wildly profitable to you and enormously valuable to your customer.

But first, let's take a breather. I want to tell you a story. Once upon a time, I met a man in Miami
who was assigned by a publisher to write a book on how to stop smoking without gaining weight.
He told me the secret of the book (eating carrots, chewing gum, who knows?) could be explained
in just a few pages. So, therefore, he had to add filler. Statistics on why smoking is bad for you.
The story of Sir Walter Raleigh. The history of tobacco usage. And on and on.

Unfortunately, you see, when it comes to written information, much of America equates value with
poundage.

What I'm talking about here, of course, is the dumb people of America.

But there's lots of smart folks out there too. People who realize that time is the irretrievable
element. People who are mature and astute enough to trade money for time. And these folks want
fast, accurate, stripped-down, no-nonsense information.

And, they're willing to pay for it.

Hmmm? I've got you thinking now, haven't I?

Another side story: Gene Schwartz, the brilliant New York copywriter, once shared with me how
he goes about creating an ad for a book. First, he hires someone to digest the book for him into
what he calls a "dialogue." Then, sometimes, he has someone else digest the digest. And then he
reads what's left and writes his ad.

I wonder? How many other people are there out there who, like me, often say to a member of
their staff:

"Hey, read this for

me and tell me

what it says."

So, what I'm saying to you this month is this: (1) a stripped- down, accurate, hard-hitting report
is the perfect product to sell via direct response, (2) the subject of the report should be something
about which you are very enthusiastic, and (3)


DON'T EVER SCREW AROUND

TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING

YOU'RE ASHAMED OF!

Why should you? Aside from the obvious ethical considerations, you have literally millions of other
options that will be infinitely more satisfying to your soul and your self-esteem.

Hey, you still with me? You are? Good. Not only are you a wondrously perceptive and gracious
human being, you also seem to have the patience of Job.

So, let's create that report. On skiing. Here's how we do it: First, we trot down to our local library
(I went to the one in beautiful downtown Burbank) and see how many books they have on skiing.
(The Burbank Library has 41 in their card index.) Next, let's ask at the reference desk for the
invaluable

SUBJECT GUIDE TO

BOOKS IN PRINT

This is a huge, 2-volume reference work published by R. R. Bowker Company in New York City. It
contains the title and other info on almost every book that is currently in print. (Once, I read
every title in this reference and went into a bookstore in Canton, Ohio and ordered 605 books at
one crack.)

So anyway, let's look up skiing and see what's listed. Hmn? Would you believe there are 130
titles?

Press on. Press on. Press on. Let's go over to the:

READER'S GUIDE TO

PERIODIC LITERATURE

And look up skiing. Where upon we will find there have been hundreds of articles written on this
subject.

Now, let's go to the biggest bookstore in town and see what they've got. And let's get a hold of
some of those ski magazines and check out the articles.

Now listen: What you do after this overview of all this material is you take possession of a bunch
of it. You check out some of the books from the library, buy some of the books from the
bookstore, locate and Xerox some of the articles mentioned in the Reader's Guide to Periodic
Literature, you clip out articles from the ski magazines you learned about from the SRDS Book and
the Standard Periodical Directory and so forth.


Now, lock yourself in a room and start reading.

And every once in a while, stop reading the ski stuff and start reading from your collection of
headlines. You do have a collection of headlines, don't you?

And then go back to the ski stuff. And later back to the headlines. And then back to the ski stuff.
And back to the headlines and. . . and. . . and. . .

BINGO!

Yeah! Somewhere in here you're going to have an "aha experience."

That's where you say: "Aha! I've got a great idea."

And then you develop that idea into a written report that tells skiers something that would be
really valuable for them to know. Maybe it's:

How To Ski Everyday

And Get Paid For It!

- or -

10 Ways To Get

Discounts On Ski Equipment!

- or -

How To Avoid Lift

Lines No Matter How

Big The Crowd!

- or -

Ski Better Instantly!

Or whatever.

And you're on your way to making a lot of money by selling a product of which you are proud and


which delivers real value.

Like this newsletter.

Merry Christmas andGod Bless You,

Gary C. Halbert

The Peewee of TV(but wait till next year)

P.S. I met a guy in Akron, Ohio once who turned his passion for model airplanes into
a 10 million dollar business. What he did is he had a bunch of middle-aged ladies
making models of Piper Cubs, Cessnas and so forth and he sold the manufacturers of
those planes on the idea of giving every new purchaser of a new plane an exact
replica model the guy could take home and sit on his TV or to the office and display it
on his desk. Neat gimmick, eh?

P.P.S. What's all that yammering and jammering out there from all you folks who
already have a product you're proud of? Brighten up. Reading all this hasn't been in
vain. You see, you should consider creating a report related to what you're selling
and feature it in your ads and give it away as a premium. It'll serve two purposes:
(1) it'll pump up your sales, and (2) if you're not already doing it, it'll enable you to
measure the response of each of your appeals.

P.P.P.S. Hey, can you believe that the Subject Guide to Books in print lists 13 titles
on skull abnormalities and deformities? Or that there is a news magazine for bingo
operators? And at least two magazines (combined circ.: 42,808) for people who like
to hunt for treasure?

See what happens when I get carried away?

How To Get As Much Money AsYou Need To "Roll Out" Your ProjectAnd Get It Without Borrowing

My newsletter goes out all over the world. Many of my subscribers are extremely successful and
many of them have enormous amounts of money.

These people are in contact with me on an almost daily basis and they are always asking my
opinion on different areas of their business activities. Sometimes they want my opinion on a
person they may or may not decide to hire. Other times they want to know if I think their current
marketing campaign could be improved. Often, they send me their ads and sales letters for
critique.

And so on.

However, one of the most common questions I am asked is if I know about any new and tested
ideas in which they can invest money.

Now, let me tell you something: If you have a totally unproven idea that you are "hoping" will
work, then, I probably can not help you. On the other hand, if you have an idea that you have
tested with good results then, my friend, I may be able to direct you to one or more people who
may very well be willing to totally finance your business in return for a share of your profits.

Look, testing your ideas will cost you some money. However, when you read Section 5 of this
report, you will learn how to test an ad in a daily newspaper at the lowest possible cost. And, if
you are a real hustler, you can use the info in Section 9 to mail thousands of sales letters virtually
free.

Besides that, if you decide to test your idea via "conventional" direct mail, it should only cost you
$1,500.00 or so if you are willing to do most of the work (addressing, sealing, stuffing etc.)
yourself. So anyway, once you do your test and you have actual numbers then, here is what you


do. You write me a letter something like this:

Dear Gary,

Sometime ago I had an idea for selling a report my wife wrote on "How to Lose
Weight Without Starving" and I wrote a newspaper ad offering her report for sale. I
ran the ad in the Podunk Daily News which has a circulation of 53,000 and the ad
cost me $1,200.00 for a 1-time insertion.

I priced the report at $12.00 plus $1.50 postage and it costs me about $3.50 to fill
an order. Therefore, every order yields up $10.00 in "contribution to overhead." My
ad pulled in 220 orders for a total gross of $2,970.00.

At $3.50 to fill an order it cost me $770.00 to fill all my orders. Therefore, my total
costs ($770.00 to fill orders and $1,200.00 to pay for the ad) were $1,970.00 which,
when subtracted from my gross of $2,970.00 left me a bottom-line profit of...

$1,000.00.

Please let me know if you know anyone who would be interested in funding this
project for a share of the profit.

 Sincerely,

 So and So

O.K., as soon as I receive such a letter from you or someone else, what I do is, I immediately put
the world out to my network of potential investors and usually there is some very fast action!

Think about it and, if you ever need funding to promote your proven ideas, I welcome your call.

By the way, my phone number is...

(305) 534-7577

And my FAX number is (352) 861-1665.

This section contains the complete text of the 9/1/88 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

How To Get Movie and TVStarts To Help You SellYour Products and Services

Some people who scuba dive are into photography. Others just like to cruise around underwater
enjoying the scenery. Others like to explore wrecks. And so on. Not me. No. What I'm into is. . .

WANTON SLAUGHTER!

I'm telling you, there is nothing like going 60 feet down into an absolutely enchanting underwater
world, staying there long enough so that the inhabitants of that world come to accept you,
conducting yourself in a non-threatening way and then, when you get those underwater creatures
to trust you enough to come up and timidly and curiously check you out. . .

YOU KILL THEM!

Oh God, how I love it! So anyway, earlier this summer, I was diving with Paulette at Sombrero
Reef in the Florida Keys and, being possessed by the urge to slaughter, I was finning around while
carrying a huge spear gun. And soon, I spotted a stupid little tropical fish and I dropped him just
like I was Dirty Harry. And then, I spot a yellowtail. And "POW!" Another one bites the dust.

Now, the way it usually works is, I get to carry the spear gun and do all the killing and Paulette
gets to carry the game bag into which we put the bloody speared fish. However, since I've become
supremely eager to share with Paulette the joy of slaughter, this time, after I get my two fish, we
trade and she's got the spear gun and I've got the game bag with the two bloody wounded fish.
And there we are, happily swimming along when. . .

WE COME UPON A SHARK!


And what does Paulette do, God bless her soul? She grabs my shoulder, points to the shark, gives
me the spear gun and. . .

SHE TAKES BACK THE GAME BAG!

Well, nothing happened. After a bit, the shark swims away and we continue our dive. And, when
we get back to the boat, I give Paulette a lot of praise. I tell her she did just right. "Yessir baby,
anytime we see any of those nasty old sharks, it is your duty to make sure it is you who is
carrying the game bag with all those wounded, bloody fish."

That's a true story. I swear.

Now, I'll tell you something. No matter how long you've been diving, no matter how macho you
think you are. . .A SHARK WILL ALWAYS GET YOUR ATTENTION! And last month, I told you that
your first job, if you want to sell somebody something, is to get their attention. And I revealed to
you how you could do this by writing what I call "killer" headlines. Remember?

OK, good. But I'm not finished. This month I'm going to take it a bit further and expand on two
more ideas that, just like that shark, will always get attention. These ideas are not appropriate for
all situations, all the time but, when they are appropriate, they can very dramatically increase the
effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.

So, what is it that will always get attention? The answer is. . .

PICTURES OF HOTSEXY WOMEN!

But be careful! If you don't do it right, putting sex appeal into your ads can backfire like crazy.
Consider the plight of the Playboy Channel which has the highest percentage of "disconnects" of
any cable hookup. Why? It's simple: The Playboy Channel is too risqué for the bible thumpers and
not raunchy enough when compared with what today's smut viewers can get from X-rated films
and videos.

Such is life. Too bad for Playboy.

Anyway, I want to impress upon you that there is a fine line between using pictures of sexy
women to attract attention and going too far and ending up offending those very people whose
attention you have captured. And know this: Using pictures of sexy women will always offend
some people, no matter how tame the pictures! Therefore, if you are the type of person (or else,
you work for the type of organization) that won't ever risk deliberately offending anybody, then
you should never use sexy pictures in your promotions.

On the other hand, for the rest of my smut-minded readers (just kidding, just kidding), using such
pictures (if you do it right) can help you rake in mucho fungolas.

And, what's the first step to doing it right? Simple: It's using the right woman in your ads. You
see, just because a woman is beautiful doesn't mean she will photograph beautiful. I had a
"funny" experience once. There was a model I wanted to use in an astrology ad but I'd only seen


her pictures, and I wanted to meet her in person. Well, the photographer said OK, he'd set up the
meeting but that I'd better be prepared for a shock.

And wow, did I ever get one! You see, this woman who looked so great in pictures was truly just a
"Plain Jane" (and I'm being kind) in person. It was weird. I was sitting at my desk looking at her
pictures with one eye and looking at her in the flesh with the other and I could hardly believe it
was the same lady.

On the other hand, there are plenty of truly gorgeous women who look just awful when they are
photographed. So therefore, don't fall in love with a pretty face until you see how pretty that face
looks when photographed.

And, speaking of pretty faces, what part of a woman's body attracts men most? Can you guess? I
bet not. You see, studies show that men are more attracted to a pretty face than any other part of
a woman's anatomy! How about that?

Onward. So anyway, Paulette and I often eat lunch at a little place down the street called CAFE
L.A. It's a neat place, right in the heart of ShowbizLand and therefore, it has, plastered on its
walls, hundreds of publicity photos of celebs, non-celebs and "would-be" celebs. And one day, as
we are walking out rather indifferent to all these hundreds of photos (as usual) we walk by one
that reaches out and virtually grabs our attention. You know, it's been said that the late Marilyn
Monroe had skin that was so photogenic that it would seem to "talk to you" from her photos. Well,
this photo we saw on the wall at CAFE L.A. has that quality. Want some proof? Just take a look at
the photo below and see for yourself.

Are you convinced? I thought so. By the way, the woman in the picture is Raven Bleu and that
picture appears on her record album called "Kiss The Boys." Whatever. So anyway, Paulette and I
make it a point to get to know Raven and, not only does she photograph like a dream, she also is
a very nice lady.

Here's the point: Her photograph really got your attention, didn't it? And likewise, using Raven's
photo, or the photo of some other photogenic lady in your promotions, will also get the attention
of your customers!

But please, be careful. If you are selling bibles to old ladies or, if you are selling something to a
bunch of phony, stuffed-shirt prudes, you may get some backlash you are not prepared to handle.
It's a "judgment call" and only you can make it.

So, where do you get pictures of foxy women like Raven to use in your ads? It's deceptively
simple: Just look in the yellow pages under Modeling Agencies and you'll find all you need.

So now, here I am, a sitting duck to get bitch letters from my female readers telling me I'm a
male chauvinist pig and I don't deserve to live. I can see it now! Here sits Ms. Elizabeth Adams out
there in Baltimore about to write:

Dear Scumbag,
I always suspected you were aslimy pig and now I know it's true.


Please Liz, don't do it. I don't deserve it because I'm really a nice scumbag.

But anyway, just to keep Liz and Alicia Evans and all those other fine ladies out there happy, I
guess I'd better reveal the other side of the coin. Which is, using attractive men in your
promotions. Now, I must tell you, this is the kind of stuff (using men) that offends even me but,
my job is not to pass judgment. No, my job is to help you make a buck.

So here this: Some time ago I did a piece of work for a client in Arizona and it did really well. And
then, the client wanted to know if there was any way to punch it up even more. So I say to him,
"Look, if you want to spend some extra dough, why don't you let me get you a celebrity to feature
in your ad?" And he tells me to go for it and I get him Geoffrey Scott, who plays Krystle's (Linda
Evans) ex-husband on Dynasty. What happens next is we make Geoffrey Scott the star of the ad
and we get a nice bump up of the gross (somewhere between 15% and 20%) which, in turn,
means an even more dramatic bump up of the net since, once your fixed overhead is taken care
of, a 1% increase in gross probably translates to a 3% increase in net profit. By the way, that's
Geoff in the picture below.

Paulette thinks this guy is good-looking but I can't see it, can you? OK, now listen: There's a
"mindset" you have to have if you are going to use a celebrity in a profitable way. For example, in
my opinion, I doubt that many people switch from Pepsi to Coke (or vice versa) because Michael
Jackson or Mike Tyson endorse one or the other.

On the other hand though, I do believe that using someone with some "marquee value" can
dramatically enhance a mail order/direct response type promotion because they tend to both
glamorize and. . .

"CREDENTIAL" THE PROMOTION!

I've said it before and I'll say it again: The #1 reason people do not buy from you is they are
simply not interested in your offer. However, once you overcome that first hurdle, the #2 reason
they don't buy from you is that they are not completely convinced you are for real. And therefore,
what a celebrity can do for you is, he can make you more credible.

Which translates to lots more sales.

You know, of course, that the cosmetic ads I did for Tova Borgnine were hugely successful, don't
you? Well, Ernie was featured prominently in those ads and, if you ask me, I don't think anybody
bought those cosmetics because they wanted to look like Ernest Borgnine. But nevertheless,
Ernie's celebrity did credential the ads; he did validate the ads; he made them more credible; he
made them more believable.

So, how much does it cost to get a celeb? Well, that varies and the first thing you've got to make
sure of is that you are dealing with a "sane celebrity." And trust me, they're sort of rare. You
know, it takes a lot of people to make a hit movie or TV show. It takes writers, cameramen,
electricians, directors, producers, lighting technicians and a whole host of others. However, there
are many "insane" celebrities who believe the sun rises and sets on their silly asses and that they
are the sole reason for a production's success.


And, as Marlon Brando once said, "An actor is a guy who, if you ain't talking about him, he ain't
listening."

And, as Gary Halbert says, "Don't let any agent or celebrity BS you into believing you have to pay
megabucks to get the credentialing you need. You don't."

And besides, paying megabucks for all that celebrity firepower doesn't guarantee you anything. A
case in point: Last year a major player in cable TV produced a show designed to sell water
purifiers and they used Michael Landon and a bunch of other stars. I hear by the grapevine the
show cost $250,000 and it flopped so bad it was like it never ran.

And what's the tragedy? It's simply that they could have produced that show for less than 20% of
what they paid and still used stars with enough "marquee value" to give them all the credentialing
they needed.

By the way, did you know that fewer than 1% of all the actors and actresses in the entire world
can support themselves solely via their chosen profession? It's true, most of them (even many
well-known ones) have a second job or another source of income.

What I'm saying is this: You can get a lot of "sane" celebrities for $10,000 or less, especially if you
offer a "carrot" to sweeten the deal such as a nice bonus if the test campaign works or maybe a
percentage of sales.

Now, let's talk about how you go about approaching a celebrity. Well, the worst way I can think of
is to telephone his or her agent. Agents are scum. As a general rule, I'd rank them somewhere
just above lawyers and slightly below ax murderers. Agents, I believe, probably kill more deals for
their clients than they make!

You take a star who's starving, who hasn't worked in six years, who would be eager to make a fair
buck being featured in a marketing campaign and, if you call his agent. . .

HE'LL QUOTE YOU A FEE SO OUTLANDISHYOU'LL THINK YOU ASKED HIM THEPRICE OF A STUDIO, NOT OF A STAR!

And you'll say forget the whole thing and. . .

THE STAR WILL NEVER KNOW THECONVERSATION TOOK PLACE!

But know this: If you submit an offer in writing, the agent is compelled by the "ethics" of his
profession to pass that offer on to his client!

Now the specifics: If you are interested in hiring a celebrity, the first thing you should do is to get
yourself a copy of the. . .

ACADEMY PLAYERS DIRECTORY


The price of this directory is $75 plus $10 S&H and it is updated every four months.

It is published by and, you order it from:

Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences8949 Wilshire BoulevardBeverly Hills, California 90211-1972

Telephone (310) 247-3000Fax (310) 859-9351Email: ampas@oscars.orgwww.acadpd.org/infoabout.html

This directory comes in four volumes and each of those volumes features 8 to 10 celebrities per
page. The celebrities are categorized by LEADING WOMEN, INGENUES, LEADING MEN, YOUNGER
LEADING MEN, CHARACTERS AND COMEDIENNES, CHILDREN GIRLS AND CHILDREN BOYS. All in
all, the set I have (May 1987) has about 15,840 actors and actresses. Now, before you get
intimidated by the idea of contracting these people, consider this:

FEWER THAN 200 OF THE 15,000+ PEOPLE INTHE ACADEMY DIRECTORY EARN ENOUGH FROMACTING TO PAY THE RENT!

So there. Now, the directory has a picture of each actor and actress, it tells you the name and
phone number of the talent agency that represents them and, in many cases the phone number of
their "commercial" agency plus the name and number of their personal manager plus. . .

THE NUMBER OF THEIR ANSWERING SERVICEWHERE YOU CAN LEAVE MESSAGES FOR THEM!

Hoo! Haa! You're starting to get the picture, aren't you? Yea verily, what you do is you leaf
through the directory till you find someone you'd like to work with and then you make a written
offer rather like this:

Dear Celebrity-Type Person,

I am writing to you in care of your agency because I would like to use you in an advertising
campaign.

My budget for the test campaign allows me to pay you an immediate $10,000 (NOTE: This will
take about 30-minutes work on your part) and, if the test campaign is successful, I am prepared
to pay you a royalty on sales which could amount to several hundred thousand dollars.

Also, I am working against a deadline and I need to hear from you within the next week.
Therefore, because of the time pressure on me, I am sending a copy of this letter to your personal
manager, your talent agency and I am leaving this message verbally with your answering service.


 Sincerely,

John Jones

Trust me, my friend, that message will get through.

By the way, you should especially consider using some "star power" if you do a lot of business by
direct mail since, a letter from a star (with his picture on the letterhead) will give you a huge
advantage over your competitors!

One last thought: What if you want to use one of those rare (1 in 100,000,000) pictures of people
who are so incredibly good looking that they divert attention from your message? Well, in that
case, don't put the picture on the letterhead. No, that would be unkind. Use the picture down by
the signature so your reader won't see it and be dazzled by it until he's finished reading your
message.

 Sincerely,

 Gary C. Halbert

 "Kindness Personified"

P.S. By the way, if you'd like to see Geoffrey Scott, (a celebrity who can pay the rent
and is "sane" anyway and a genuine nice guy), you don't have to go through any
hassle at all; just call me!

P.P.S. Two other sources of celebrities for promotions are Ingels Inc., 8111 Beverly
Boulevard, Suite 308, Los Angeles, CA 90048 (213) 852-0300 and Don Camp (213)

P.P.P.S. When you use celebs like Raven and Geoff you also get the "reflected glory"
of all their credits because you can legitimately mention in your copy all the
magazines (Playboy, Vogue, etc.) and the TV shows (Dynasty, etc.) and movies and
stuff they've been in. More credentialing!

SECTION #5 This section contains the complete text of the 8/1/87 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

An Amazing Secret That Can Make Your Newspaper
Advertising 750% More Profitable

Over the course of my career, I've written a veritable bushel of full-page newspaper ads. In fact, as mentioned in last month's
letter, someone once calculated that if all my ads were being run by just one company (instead of separate clients) that that
company would be the third largest newspaper advertiser in the United States.

Just behind Delta Airlines, they told me.

Could that be true? I really don't know. It sounds a little far-fetched to me. However, one thing is sure: there is an excellent
chance that you can use what I've learned about how to make newspaper ads pay off to make yourself (or your company) a
real bundle of money. Do you have a direct mail promotion that's working? If so, and especially if that direct mail package
has wide consumer appeal, you should definitely consider giving daily newspapers a test.

It's easy. First of all, your copy is already written. All you've got to do is "reformat" your direct mail package so it is suitable
to run in a paper.

Not only is it easy, it's also cheap. If you know what you're doing, you can run a full-page ad in a good test paper like the
Los Angeles Herald Examiner or the Fort Lauderdale News Sun Sentinel for less than $3,000.00.

And, not only is it cheap and easy, it's fast! If I'm really motivated, I can often take a direct mail package I receive from a
client on a Monday, and have that package reappear as a full-page ad on the following Monday, just six days later.

And you can read your results fast too. If you accept phone orders, you can often tell whether or not you have a winner the
very same day the ad runs! And, even if your customer can only respond by mail, it will still only be a few days before you
have the answer.

So, with all this going for it, why don't more direct marketers use daily newspapers?

It's the same old story: they don't know how. And neither do the ad agencies they hire to help them either. Did you know
that there is not one ad agency in America that knows how to insure maximum readership from a full-page newspaper ad?
I'd just love to be challenged on this. If you think I'm exaggerating, just stop reading for a moment and take enough time to


call your current ad agency (or any agency in the phone book) and ask them how to do it. Then, compare the info in the rest
of this newsletter with the garbage you just heard on the phone.

But so what? You didn't subscribe to this newsletter to learn my opinion of ad agencies, did you? So, let's get to the heart of
it. Listen: it has often been said that the three most important factors in choosing investment real estate are (1) location, (2)
location and, (3) location. I think that's probably true. And, when it comes to running ads in newspapers, a similar precept
needs to be held in mind. Namely, that the most important factor of all is . . .

POSITION! POSITION! POSITION!

Hark unto me. The #1 reason people don't respond to a newspaper ad is because they don't see it! Daily newspapers are
huge. Many of them are several hundred pages thick. In fact, a recent edition of the L.A. Times contained 405 pages!

Whooee! You sure could get lost in there, couldn't you?

Now look, if you ask a normal (dumb) advertising guy, where in the paper should you run your ad, he'll probably reply by
asking what you are selling. Then, if you are selling a sporting goods item, he'll tell you, you should run in the sports
section. And, if you are running an ad for an astrology book, it should go in the horoscope section. And a cookbook should
go in the food section.

And so on.

And he'll also tell you that you should try to get a right hand page as far forward in the paper as possible.

Actually, all this is sort of true. But it's a dangerous sort of truth. It can lead to disaster. You want to know what most
advertising guys remind me of? It's this: they remind me of a guy who's had three or four karate lessons. You know what a
guy like this has learned? He's learned just enough to get himself stomped silly if he ever foolishly decides to darken the
door of a tough redneck bar.

So true. Anyway, remember how I am incessantly preaching that the people of America sort through their mail while
standing over a wastebasket? You do remember? Good. Now, here is something else for your to keep in mind:

As soon as the people of Americasit down to peruse their dailynewspapers, they immediatelydivide it by sections.

A man may ask his wife for the sports pages. The wife might zero in on the food section. Their kids may ask for the comics.
Entrepreneurs may want the business section. Gossip mongers may pick up the society pages.

And so on.

But nobody reads the entire paper. In fact, hardly anybody even opens up more than two or three sections. Think about it, do
you?

So, what does all this mean on a practical basis? This: it means the very best place your ad can appear for maximum
visibility (and hence, maximum readership) is on the front page of a section.


And the second best place? It's the back page of a section.

Here's why. You see, even though most people don't read or even open up every section, most people at least touch every
section. Yes, they touch it if for no other reason than to pick it up to hand it to someone else or to throw it away. And, while
they are thus handling each section, they are forced to at least glance at the front pages of those sections and (to a lesser
degree) the back pages of said sections.

And, of course, while they are glancing at those pages, should they happen to see an eye-catching ad, an ad with a "killer"
headline, they just might read a couple of paragraphs to see what it is all about. And, if those first couple of paragraphs are
real good, then just maybe they'll read the rest of the ad. And, if all that happens, who knows, maybe you'll get an order.

So, know this: your first job is not to get your customer to read your ad. No. Your first job is to get him to see your ad!

It's just common sense. Look: an ad that appears on the inside of the sports pages will be seen by everybody who reads the
sports section. However, if that same ad appears on the front or back of any section, it will be seen not only by sports fans
but also by nearly everybody who handles the paper!

I know. I know. You think I'm making an awful big deal about this point, don't you? Well, I guess I am. But I'm not going to
apologize. I don't care. I don't think there is anyone on the planet who can touch me when it comes to making full-page ads
work in daily papers. And, believe it or not, as simple as it seems, you have just learned my numero uno secret which is:

RUN YOUR AD ON THEFRONT OR BACK OF A SECTION!

So much for numero uno. Now for numero duo. In a nutshell, my second big secret is:

MAKE YOUR AD LOOKLIKE A NEWS STORY

Don't make it look like an ad. Don't use line art. Don't use arrows, cute graphics, reverse type (except maybe to highlight a
phone number), weird typestyles . . .

OR ANYTHING ELSE THATMIGHT WIN AN AWARDFOR GRAPHIC DESIGN

Come closer. Listen: here is how to "think" about your newspaper ads. Think about what could be the best possible piece of
luck you could have. Think about a reporter who heard a rumor about your product or service and decided to check it out.
And then, he fell in love with it. In fact, he loved it so much, he went back to his type-writer and wrote a full-page rave
article about what you are selling.

Wouldn't that be nice? Sure would. However, it is also unlikely that such a thing will happen. So . . .

YOU BE THAT REPORTER!

You write the rave "article." Just like a reporter would. And, at the end of the article, you perform a "public service" for your


readers by telling them where and how to order. But, after all this, don't screw up by having your "article" typeset to look
like an ad.

No. No. Noooo. It should be typeset to look like the "article" it is. You know, ad agencies just love to quote studies that
prove how much people love to read advertising.

Garbage! Garbage! Garbage!

Editorial material (or material that appears to be editorial) gets 500% more readership than material that is obviously
advertising.

So be it.

Now, a cunningly careful, highly scientific examination of daily newspapers will yield yet another useful bit of data.
Namely...

Newspapers all come
folded in half

Hmmm? So what's the big deal about that? This: it is not necessary to unfold a newspaper to separate one section from
another. And, what this means, of course, is that, in the process of separating a newspaper by sections, a person may only
have to glance at either the top half or the bottom half of the front or back page of each section.

Not both halves.

Now, if it's the top half at which he glances, that's fine! That's where your headline is. And we all know what a headline is,
don't we? A headline, of course, is . . .

AN AD FOR YOUR AD!

But wait. What if our reader, while separating his paper into sections, is doing it in such a way so that he only has to glance
at the bottom half of each section? Where there is no headline? No ad for our ad?

Gadzooks. This is no good. No good. No good. So, what we've got to do here is make sure the bottom half of our ad has
several subheads (little ads for our ad) interspersed between paragraphs and printed in bold type.

Sort ofLike This

What else? Oh yeah, if you really want to make newspapers work, you've also got to buy them right! This is a real art and,
trust me, there aren't any ad agencies (even the big ones) who have the faintest idea of how to do it.

Here's a story about someone who does know how. Once upon a time, I owned a publishing company with offices in North
Canton, Ohio and also at 535 Madison Avenue, right in the heart of the Big Apple. Well, at that time, I was buying a truly
enormous amount of newspaper space. In fact, you probably wouldn't believe just how much. So anyway, back then, one of
the guys who worked for my company hired a new gal to do some secretarial work for him. Her name was Nancy Jones and,
over a period of time, she got into buying media for us. Soon, she became better at buying space than any of my executives


and, for sure, far better than me. The years have rolled by. My publishing company was sold many moons ago but Nancy, on
her own, has continued to sharpen her space buying skills. And, I'll tell you this:

When it comes to buyingspace in daily newspapers,
Nancy Jones is the beston the planet!

Period.

Proof: here is a slightly edited and bowdlerized version of a letter Nancy wrote (I wish I could figure out some way to steal
the credit and claim I wrote it) to a large number of newspapers:

Dear Advertising Director,

Over the past several years, our client, the XYZ Company, has repeatedly expressed an interest in having his advertisements
published in your newspaper.

However, our agency has compared your open rate with that of newspapers where the advertisement has already been
published and we have found it necessary to advise the client against including your newspaper in his advertising schedules.
This decision was based mainly on the fact that the client's advertisement has been profitable only in those newspapers
where a stand-by or remnant rate has been offered.

As you know, stand-by simply means that a newspaper agrees to publish an advertisement whenever or wherever space
becomes available and offers to reduce the open line rate to the advertiser for "standing by." Space may become available
due to last minute cancellations of scheduled advertisements or because of production difficulties. Whatever the reason, the
newspaper will generally insert a house ad or a public service ad to fill the hole in the newspaper. Therefore, more often
than not, the newspaper receives no revenue for the use of this space.

Thus, stand-by advertising has become advantageous for both the newspaper and the advertiser. The newspaper has the
opportunity to make money on space it might otherwise have to give away. The advertiser is able to use a publication it
could not use at the open rate.

More and more newspapers are becoming involved in stand- by advertising. Enclosed is a current list of newspapers
offering a stand-by program and the discounts they allow. We are aware that your newspaper has not offered a stand-by
rate in the past but we would like very much for you to consider this possibility now. We are enclosing an insertion order for
a full page, a mechanical and a check for the new amount of the order. The net amount has been computed at the open rate
discounted by 50% for stand-by, normal for the industry, and 15% for the standard agency discount.

If you accept our offer, simply hold the material until space becomes available. If and when the opportunity presents itself,
run the ad, cash the check, and send us a tear sheet. If you do not wish to participate at this time, simply return the check to
the agency and destroy the mechanical.

This offer expires in 15 days. Please feel free to call if you have any questions about the offer or our client.


Sincerely,

Nancy Jones

So, guess what has happened as a result of that letter? This:

72% of the papers responded
on a favorable basis and Nancy Jones
can now buy more newspapers at
a more favorable rate than any"sophisticated" media buyerworking in any ad agencyanywhere in the U.S.!

Here's a list of just ten papers showing the card rate (the rate ad agencies get) and the "stand-by" rate that Nancy gets:

Daily Open Nancy's

And so on.

Note: These rates change often and this is just a few of the hundreds of papers with which Nancy deals. Not only that, I have
purposely listed only a few of the little papers with whom she does business. But rest assured, she gets similar discounts
from many of the biggies.

Whatever. I'm running out of gas. Therefore, here is a summation of some of the secrets that have helped transform Sir
Gary, the Ravin' Maven of Marketing into the Ace of Space and Prince of Print:

A. Try to run your full-page ads on either the front or the back of a section.

B. Make your ad look like an article.

C. Pepper your ad with subheads, especially the lower half (that half that appears below the fold) of
the ad.

D. Buy cheap. Nancy Jones can be reached at (727) 535-7899, 1001 Starkey Rd. #111, Largo, FL

A final point: would you like to know how to get more mileage out of this newsletter? It's simple. After you've read it once
for yourself, read it again aloud to someone else. You'll be surprised how this little trick will make the info and insights
come alive and how it will have a synergistic effect and spark a lot of ideas.

Besides, it will help spread the word of my wonderfulness.

Sincerely,

Gary C. HalbertA man who is truly "a legend in his own mind."

P.S. Next month will be the first anniversary of this newsletter.
Therefore, it will be a very special issue!

Trust me.

P.P.S. Do you need "roll-out" money for a tested ad or direct mail
package? If so, call me.

SECTION #6

How To Get The Exact Name And Address Of
Every Man, Woman And Child Who Is Ever
Likely To Become One Of Your Customers!

If you learn how to use direct mail properly, the results can be so amazing it may take your breath away!

I'm not kidding. Here's an example: once upon a time, I wrote a simple, one-page letter that sold a "family name research
report" that told you about the history of your name and some facts (including a drawing) of the earliest known coat-of-arms
that was recorded with your surname. Now, would you care to guess how many cash-with-order customers I got from that
one-page letter? It's really quite astonishing because I sold those little reports to....

7,300,000 different people!

All from a simple, one-page letter. Isn't that something? By the way, it took more than 40 people just to make the bank
deposits because, often, we'd receive more than 20,000 checks in a single day.

So, as you can see, if you use direct mail and, do it right, it can really pay off!

Now, as far as doing it right is concerned, the most important element of all is the mailing list. It doesn't matter how
attractive your offer or how brilliant your sales letter if you mail to the wrong list you're going to flop.

What mailing lists should you use? Well, that depends on what kind of business you're in. If you've got a business like a
restaurant, a hardware store or some other kind of retail establishment, your choices are pretty much obvious because, what
you need is simply the names and addresses of everyone who lives in your trading area. In other words, what you need is a
"resident" list.

A list like this is very easy to obtain. Actually, if you live in a fair sized city, it may very well be as easy as looking under
"mailing lists" in the yellow pages of your telephone book. Here is Los Angeles, for example there are 31 entries under
mailing lists in the Pacific Bell Business to Business yellow pages. One of these companies is called Mailing Lists of
Southern California (800) 352-7450, (www.wholesalemailinglists.com) and they have the name and address of almost
everyone who lives in southern California and you can order by zip code.


You can also specify if you want homeowners only or apartment dwellers only. You can get the names of all the
chiropractors, all the nurses, the real estate brokers, tax preparers, optometrists and many other types of occupations. You
can also order all the boat owners, business owners (by category) and almost any other selection your little heart desires.

Here's an example of how you can use these mailing lists. Let's suppose you own a restaurant. Well, what you could do is
order all the names and addresses of all the 6,486 dentists in southern California and send them a letter like this:

Dear Friend,

I am writing this letter to you because you are a dentist. Here is why. My name is John Jones and I own
John's restaurant here in Anytown, and I have decided that every day next month I am going to serve free
wine with every meal to every dentist who comes in for dinner. Want to know why? It's a very unusual
reason and, if you'll ask me about it, I'll tell you when you drop in.

Sincerely,

John JonesOwner

Now, why are you offering a "dentist's special" for your restaurant? I don't know. Maybe because your daughter married a
dentist and she didn't end up marrying that Padagonian pigmy you were worried about. Maybe because a dentist did
something to save you from periodontal disease. And, if this approach works, why not have a special for insurance agents, or
accountants or architects and so on?

This is an example of "customizing" your advertising to a specific group. You can also customize it by geographic area, by
boat owners or what have you.

Now, listen: if there aren't any companies under "Mailing Lists" in your phone book, all is not lost. You see, there is a big
national company who also have the name and addresses of nearly everyone in your geographic area. So, if you don't luck
out with a local company, you should call either Acxiom Infobase at (888) 459-3282, Website: www.acxiom.com/infobase
or Donnelly List Marketing at (800)-711-4913; Fax (203) 552-6334; Website: www.donnelleymarketing.com.

By the way, these last two companies can also select by make, year and model of car. Do you know what that means? Just
this: it means you can also have a "Ferrari Special" a "Chevy Special" a "Ford Special" and so on.

O.K., what we've been talking about so far are compiled lists. Another type of list is known as a "buyers list." This type of
list is usually much more responsive but, often, it is not regional in nature. A "buyer" list for example, might contain all the
names of the several million people who bought a certain diet product in the last few years. Or, it could be a list of people
who have bought books by mail, tools by mail, etc.

There are two primary sources that have info on these types of lists. The first is the Standard Rate & Data (SRDS) List
Book. This is a huge book that contains a description of literally thousands of different mailing lists. Your library should
have it (ask for SRDS Direct Mail Lists Rates and Data) and, if they don't you can call SRDS direct at (800) 851-7737; Fax
(847)375-5001; Website: www.srds.com.


By the way, I strongly suggest you get a copy of this publication (it's being updated all the time) and spend about 20 hours
just reading all the various listings.

Believe me, it will really open your eyes!

The other source for those names, is your handy, dandy list broker. A list broker works very much like a real estate broker
except that his product is names and addresses rather than homes. Once again, your phone book is the first place you should
check to find a list broker in your city. If there aren't any in your local area, I suggest you go to your library and see if they
have, as many libraries do, the phone books from major cities all over the country. If they do, then simply check under
"Mailing List Brokers" in the yellow pages of the phone book of the largest city that is near you.

And, just for insurance, I'm going to give you here the names and phone numbers of five list brokers in different parts of the
U.S. Here they are:

1. Los Angeles - Thulin Communications, Inc.
(818) 752-1800; Fax (818) 752-1808

2. New York – WalterKarl
(914) 620-0700; Fax (914) 620-0612

3. Chicago - Aggressive List Management, Inc.
(847) 304-4030; Fax (847) 304-4032; Email: alminc1@aol.com

4. Kansas – List Locators & Manager
(913) 338-5055; Fax (913) 338-1078; Web: www.listlocators.com

5. Ohio – Penton Lists
(216) 931-9502; Fax (216) 696-6662; Email: cbrookins@penton.com

Now, once you decide which lists you want to mail, you should also give some consideration as to how you are going to
eliminate "deadwood" names that probably will never become one of your customers. Some of the ways you do this are very
simple and only require a little common sense. If, for example, you are selling something that only appeals to women, you
instruct the list broker or list owner to simply eliminate all men from the list.

However, it's not always that simple. Suppose, for example, you are selling an upscale product with a big price tag and you
know that lower income people are not good prospects for you. Well, what you need to know here is that some of the bigger
list companies like Donnelly & Acxiom use what is known as a "demographic overlay." What this means is that each name
on their files is "coded" with info about the aggregate value of the vehicles they own, their education and income level, their
marital status and a dozen or so more "life styles indicators" that enables you to select only those people who are most likely
to purchase your goods or services.

Another way you can choose people is by ethnic groups such as Italians, Germans, etc. And if, for example, you are
publishing a magazine like Ebony that is written for a black audience, you can ask for only those people who live in zip
codes with predominately black households.

On the other hand, you can also eliminate black households from your mailings if you are selling something that only
appeals to Caucasians.


So, no matter what mailing list you decide to use, be sure and discuss the "selects" that are available with your list broker or
whatever mailing house you using.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that the main things you should do, as a result of reading this report is:

1. Browse through the SRDS List Book for several hours at least. It will really open your eyes, and give you
hundreds of ideas!

2. Call at least one of the list brokers or mailing houses mentioned in this report and ask for their advice!

3. Put on your "thinking cap" and think of some fresh new ways to "customize" your mailings!

And finally, good luck!

SECTION #7

What To WriteOn A Simple Postcard MailingThat Will Make PeopleFlood Into Your Business

You are about to learn all about one of the neatest little tricks I've ever developed.

Here's what you'll need to get started: (1) a mailing list that has the names and addresses of all of
your potential customers; (2) a supply of small, inexpensive first-class postcards just like the ones
you can buy right from the post office; (3) an answering machine that will let you record a
message at least two minutes in length.

Now, let's say you own a used car lot and you'd like to have a lot more customers. O.K., what you
do first is you stick one of your postcards into your handy dandy little office typewriter and you
type a message that reads something like this:

Dear Friend,

Would you like to learn an amazing secret that will help you buy good used cars at
dirt-cheap prices?

If so, all you have to do is call (000) 000-0000 and you will hear a free recorded
message that reveals how you can get some truly amazing bargains.

 Sincerely,

 John Jones

That was pretty simple, wasn't it? What you do next is you have all your postcards printed up with
this same message and address them to everybody on your list.


Now, what you've got to do is write out a little telephone "script" and it might read something like
this:

THANK YOU FOR CALLING.

MY NAME IS JOHN JONES AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW I LEARNED TO BUY
GOOD USED CARS AT PRICES SO LOW I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT.
FIRST OF ALL, DID YOU KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONFISCATE
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CARS EVERY YEAR FROM DRUG DEALERS AND
OTHER CRIMINALS?
WELL, IT'S TRUE AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN BUY THESE CARS AT EXTREMELY LOW
PRICES. RECENTLY:
FOR EXAMPLE, I BOUGHT A 1982 FORD FOR ONLY $2400 AND A 1985 PLYMOUTH
FOR ONLY $750.
THE WAY YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THESE CARS IS BY GETTING ON THE BIDDING LIST
OF YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND ALL THE LOCAL
AND FEDERAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. JUST LOOK THEM UP IN THE
TELEPHONE BOOK AND CALL THEM AND TELL THEM YOU WANT TO BE ON THEIR
BIDDER'S LIST.
WHEN YOU GET THE LISTS, READ THEM CAREFULLY AND DECIDE WHICH CARS YOU
ARE INTERESTED IN AND GO TO THE VARIOUS AUCTIONS AND MAKE YOUR BIDS.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU NEED A CAR RIGHT
NOW, I'VE GOT 15 OF THEM I GOT FROM THESE AUCTIONS AND I CAN SELL YOU
ANY ONE OF THEM AT A PRICE SO LOW YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, YOU CAN CALL ME AT MY PRIVATE NUMBER WHICH IS (000)
000-0000. ONCE AGAIN, I'M IN THE 000 AREA CODE AND MY NUMBER IS 000-0000.
THANK YOU.

So, practice reading your script a couple of times and then record it on your answering machine.

Now, mail your postcards and sit back and wait for action!

You know this is a very simple idea but, I'm telling you, it really works like crazy. Here are some
of the reasons this works so well.

#1. You are offering free information about something your prospect is interested in.

#2. You take the "threat" out of it when your prospect learns it's a recorded message. You see,
that way, he doesn't have to worry about talking to a high-pressure salesperson.

#3. When he listens to your recording, he finds that you are a swell guy because you actually
delivered on your promise (this is crucial) and the friendliness in your voice put him at ease.


#4. And finally, you offered him a hassle-free way of solving his problem which, in this case, is the
problem of finding a good, cheap used car.

This technique can work no matter what kind of business you are in. Of course, what you write on
the postcard and what you say on the recorded message has to be "customized" to your particular
business. But, if you put on your thinking cap, that shouldn't be much of a problem. Here's what
you might write if you were a plastic surgeon, a jeweler or a stockbroker:

Dear Friend,

Did you know there is a new plastic surgery technique that can make you look 15-
years younger?

It's true. And, if you want to know about it, all you have to do is call (000) 000-0000
and listen to a free recorded message that will give you all the facts. You can call
anytime, 24-hours a day

 Sincerely,

 John Jones, M.D.

Dear Friend,

Would you like to know how to buy diamonds cheaper than a jeweler can get them?

If so, etc., etc., etc.

Dear Friend,

Would you like to know about 10 stocks that may double in price in the next 6
months?

If so, etc., etc., etc.

And so on. The important things are to offer info your prospects should be interested in, take the
fear out of it by telling them they'll get the info from a recorded message, delivering on your
promise (really give them a little important info) and then, letting them know how you can help
them and inviting them to call you or to come into your store or place of business.

How well can something like this work? Hear this: I'm doing something similar to this right now
and, just recently, I've gotten nearly 4,000 calls.

Try it, you'll like it.

Sincerely,


Gary C. Halbert

P.S. By the way, you may also want to try running a small, "postcard ad" in your
local paper. All it requires is a small change in the "look" of your copy. Here's three
examples:

HOW TO BUY L.A. REAL ESTATE AT ROCK-BOTTOM PRICES! Call (000) 000-0000 for
an amazing free recorded message. You can call anytime 24-hours per day.

HOW TO PROMOTE YOUR BUSINESS FOR LESS THAN $1,000.00! Exciting free
recorded message by world's best copywriter reveals amazing secret! Call anytime
24-hours per day. (000) 000-0000.

DID YOU KNOW THAT THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN ALSO HAS THE
LOWEST PRICES! That's because I have learned a certain "Mexican Secret" and you
can learn all about it by listening to a free recorded message. Just call (000) 000-
0000 any time 24-hours a day.

That's it. You've got the formula now and, shame on you if you don't use it.

Go for it!

SECTION #8
This section contains the complete text of the 7/3/87 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

Can It And Clone It

"There I was at 15,000 feet, both engines on fire
and my parachute in the laundry. . . ."

You ever feel like that? You've got a marketing emergency on your hands and you've got to solve it right now!

Listen: I get calls nearly every day from people who need instant marketing solutions. They're not copywriters and they have
no advertising experience. They don't trust ad agencies (and rightly so) and they haven't the luxury of enough time to
become grounded in marketing theory by reading Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins and so on. In fact, they have no desire to
become marketing experts. No. It's just that every "expert" they've ever hired has disappointed them and, since I'm usually
too booked up to do any new jobs on a "right now" basis, they want to know..."What should I do?"

"Do it by the numbers," I tell them.

Here's what I mean. Look: If you have a good product or service, you probably already know exactly how to sell it when
you are talking to someone during a "one-on-one" situation. Whether you are talking to someone in person or, perhaps, on
the telephone, it probably doesn't matter; my bet is you know exactly what words to use and what buttons to push to most
impress your prospective customer.

Am I right? Aha, I thought so.

However, here is a curious fact: most people who are very good in a personal selling situation "freeze up" when it comes to
transferring their sales pitch to the printed word.

Or else they struggle to "get creative."

Forget that rubbish. Here's a better way. The first thing you do is you begin to record (with the other party's permission) all
of your conversations whenever you are talking to one of your prospects on the phone. Keep doing this until you are able to
forget that you are doing it. Why? The reason is simple. You see, at first, when you are aware that what you are saying is
being recorded, you will stifle yourself. You'll try to make sure what you are saying is grammatically correct. Or you'll try to
be clever. Or more dramatic. Or less dramatic.


Or whatever.

But if you keep doing it long enough, you'll eventually forget about the damn tape recorder and you'll revert to being your
own natural wonderful self and you'll deliver your usual compelling sales presentation.

And hopefully, after awhile, we'll have a recording of you talking to a prospect when you are at "concert pitch."

Goody. But what's next? This: what we do next is take that recording to a typist and have it transcribed. Then, after it has
been transcribed, we take a copy of that typed transcription and number each one of the paragraphs. By the way, for our
purposes, a paragraph is one or more sentences that express a single idea or aspect of a subject.

O.K., now let's say we have the first draft of our "sales-pitch-in-print" and it contains 47 paragraphs and you have duly
numbered them 1 through 47.

Next, we carefully go over each one of these paragraphs and give each of them another number that is based on a scale of 1
to 10, 10 being highest. What we are doing here is "ranking" each paragraph as to how much favorable influence that
paragraph has on our prospect. For example, let's say we are pitching a 31 foot Bertram sport fishing boat (one of the best)
and we know from previous experience that our customers are very interested in the fact that the boat has a wide beam and a
hull configuration that makes it extremely seaworthy and very uninterested in the fact that it comes with matching curtains
and towels.

So, let's say the paragraphs about the seaworthiness of the boat get a ranking of 8 and the ones about matching curtains and
towels get a ranking of 2.

Whatever. So, what we've got now is a "sales-pitch-in- print" that is 47 paragraphs long and wherein each paragraph has
been rated for wonderfulness on a scale of 1 to 10.

Now, what I want you to do next is to cut out all those paragraphs with a pair of scissors and then divide them into three
groups. The first group will consist of those paragraphs that describe the benefits of owning a Bertram and the second group
will consist of those paragraphs that tell "interesting facts" about the boat. The third group of paragraphs will be those
paragraphs that don't say anything about the Bertram or else paragraphs that do not advance your sales presentation in any
way whatsoever.

Now, throw the third group away and arrange the other two groups in rank order from 10 on down. Next, throw out all
paragraphs with a rating of 5 or less. Next, rewrite the remaining paragraphs. But BEWARE: don't change them much. Just
more or less "clean them up." Take out the "ers" and "ums," the redundant words and sentences and sort of tighten up your
sentence structure and grammar.

Let us press on. What I'd like you to do now is try to forget you are trying to write an ad or a sales letter. Instead, what I
want you to do is to concentrate on writing a memo.

A long memo.

Write it to someone you can easily visualize in your mind's eye, someone who is a good prospect for a good, relatively
cheap sport fishing boat. Someone extremely good-looking and modest.

Someone like me, Sir Gary of Halbert, Ace of Space, Prince of Print, Count of Cable and all around Bon Vivant.


Your memo should read something like this:

MEMO

Dear Gary,

I hear you are looking for a good, seaworthy sport-fishing boat.

Listen: I've got a good one for sale. It's really a humdinger. Here are seven interesting facts about this boat:

1. (Insert highest ranked interesting fact.)

2. (Insert second highest ranked fact.)

3. (Insert third highest ranked fact.)

4. (You've got the idea, right?)

5. (Ditto)

6. (Et Cetera)

7. (and so forth)

Hey, Gary, what about those apples? Maybe now, you can see why this particular boat is such a honey.
There are many benefits to owning a boat like this. Here are five of the main ones:

1. (Insert paragraph on highest ranked benefits of owning this boat.)

2. (Insert second highest ranked paragraph.)

3. (Ditto)

4. (Et Cetera)

5. (and so forth)

Well anyway, Gary, those are just a few of the "high-lights" about the wonderfulness of this boat but,
actually, there are many more reasons it makes sense for you to own a vessel like this and I'd love to
explain them to you in person.

So here's the deal. I know you're busy, what with all your clients and writing your newsletter and scuba
diving with Paulette and so forth, so I'm gonna give you a chance to digest this memo and then, in a few
days, I'll give you a call and see if you are interested.


In the meantime, if you want more info sooner, you can call me at (000) 000-0000.

By the way, I love your newsletter and I really enjoy reading it every month in spite of your conceited,
egomaniacal ramblings.

 Sincerely,

 Joe Subscriber
An Astute Student

Now listen: I want to know something. It is this: did you think that little "lesson" was a bit too simple? If so, you are doing
yourself a great disservice. You see, if you can grasp the essence of what I've just imparted, you will have learned an
enormously important marketing lesson.

Here is that lesson:

FORGET TRYING TO
BE CREATIVE!
FORGET TRYING TOBE CLEVER!
STOP WORRYING ABOUT
THOSE AWARDS YOU'DLIKE TO WIN!

Hark unto me: your job is not to be creative, clever or win awards. No. Your job is to sell, damn it.

Selling is not yelling. Selling is not tricks. Selling is an impressive, forceful communication of facts and benefits. What I
have just taught you is a far cry from being the end-all and be-all of how to create advertising. However, that simple little
process of recording your person-to-person sales presentations and then, transferring them to paper as I have outlined works
far better than trying to "dream up" some award winning vapidness.

Check this out: There's a guy named Bruce Horovitz who writes a column on marketing which appears in the Business
Section of the Los Angeles Times every Tuesday. Recently, on June 9th, one of his articles was about a gentleman named
Sean Kevin Fitzpatrick who is executive vice president and creative director of an ad firm named Campbell-Ewald Co. The
article is about Fitzpatrick's "Heartbeat of America" commercial (which consists mostly of a catchy song) that he created for
the Chevrolet division of General Motors.

The article tells how "successful" this campaign is and how Chevrolet's current series of car and truck ads have been
nominated for 10 Clio awards.

It's a stupid commercial.

In fact, this campaign is so stupid it would appear to me that Fitzpatrick doesn't even know what advertising is. (Or at least
what it's supposed to be!) Advertising is not reminding someone of your existence; it is not song writing, dancing bears, and
tricky words and catchy music.

No! Good advertising is simply....


SALESMANSHIP MULTIPLIED

I don't know how much money has been wasted on this moronic campaign. However, I do know that, according to this same
article that, during the first quarter of 1987, Chevrolet sales are down 12.1% compared to what they were last year!

Is it any wonder?

But you know what? People who can't produce results often get very creative when it comes to creating cop-outs. And, in
the ad business, if you can't produce sales, what you do is you tell your client that you are building his "image." You tell him
how all this money he's spending will pay off sometime in "years-to-come."

Listen to this quote from another "advertising expert" in the same article: "But this campaign can't be measured in short-
term results. It is an image building campaign. Image is the key issue of the car market...blah, blah, blah."

What garbage. You know what Fitzpatrick should have done instead of writing a song? It's simple: he should have found out
who the 10 best Chevy salesmen are in the entire U.S. Then, he should have met with these men and watched them sell cars
and he should have recorded their sales presentations and taken notes.

And then, he should have created an intelligent campaign built around the best parts of those effective sales presentations!

Maybe this guy deserves to win a Grammy but he sure as hell shouldn't get any awards based on his ability to create
advertising that sells cars!

Oh, well. I suppose if it wasn't for guys like him, there wouldn't be so much demand for guys like me.

Onward. Look, I'm coming to the close of this month's letter and, before I do, I want to tell you about a couple of things that
are not directly related to marketing. I hope you'll bear with me. I'm going to tell you about one of these items because it is
so potentially important and the other because it is so utterly delightful.

ITEM 1: Back in the 70's, someone told me about a doctor who became wealthy developing some industrial
patents that were used in Europe. Apparently, he used his wealth to set up a clinic in Paris to treat patients
and do research. However, when the Nazis invaded Paris, he found it necessary to flee to the U.S. When he
got here he set up another clinic and began treating cancer patients and doing more research.

Anyway, I met this man sometime in 1971 or 1972 and I was very impressed with him. He showed me a
book he had published with remarkable before and after pictures of patients he had cured of cancer. In fact,
he autographed the book for me and he also showed me letters from some of the authorities in
"establishment medicine" that said, in effect, that although his ideas may have some merit, any real cure for
cancer will come from the establishment.

What this doctor told me is that most MD's and hospitals don't want to treat cancer patients the way he does
because it is too expensive and time-consuming.

Now, let's flash forward to a few days ago. I'm sitting in my office when I get a call from one of my clients
(an international publisher) who says: "Gary, I'm thinking about doing a book on this doctor in Manhattan.
He's 91 years old and he's been treating AIDS patients with a 100% success rate!"


"Listen," I said, "is this guy's name Revici?"

Well, guess what? It appears it's the same doctor I met!

Now, hold on. I can't vouch for the truth of what you have just read. And, it is very cruel to hold out false
hope for people who are seriously ill. However, I've heard enough about this doctor from enough sources
that, if you know someone with AIDS, you might suggest they check this guy out. He runs the Institute of
Applied Biology in Manhattan and the number is (212) 876-9669.

Once again, I'm not saying all this is true. I'm just saying it seems worthy of investigation.

(Editors note: The above phone number is no longer valid. If you would like to do research on these
subjects you might try the following: www.padrak.com/beck/; www.loa.com/~dragonfly/bbstuff.html;

www.earthdream.com/curecnc.htm; www.cancerdecision.com; www.cancer-coverup.com )

ITEM 2: I had dinner last Saturday with an old scuba buddy of mine and he introduced me to an incredible
restaurant that specializes in Southern cooking. This restaurant is called "AUNT KIZZY'S BACK PORCH"
and it is owned by a black couple named Adolf and Mary Dulan. Let me tell you, Adolf Dulan absolutely
bends over backwards to see that his guests are happy. It is a real joy to see a man with this much grace and
caring.

And the food? It is, quite simply, the best I've ever eaten in any restaurant anywhere in the world.

Period.

By the way, don't look for fancy decor. AUNT KIZZY'S is located at 4325 Glencoe Avenue which is in the
Villa Marina shopping center.

Sincerely,

Gary C. Halbert"The very most semi-handsome ad man who ever lived."

P.S. Someone once said that if all my newspaper ads were being run by one company (instead of separate
clients) that that company would be the third largest newspaper advertiser in the U.S. I don't know if that
statement was true back when it was uttered but I sure as hell have created a lot of newspaper ads that have
produced phenomenal results!

Want to know some of my secrets? Tune in next month. I dare say Bruce Horovitz won't have revealed any
of them by then.

SECTION #9

How To Mail Up To 100,000 Letters Per
Week At No Cost Whatsoever!
(not even postage)

What you are about to read is a remarkably simple idea that can be worth thousands and thousands of dollars to you. It is a
tested idea. Others are using it every day and now, it's your turn!

Listen: One of the very best ways to advertise your business is direct mail. When you use direct mail, it enables you to fire
your advertising bullets with a rifle instead of a shotgun. In other words, it lets you "target" your market.

However, there is a drawback. You see, direct mail is very expensive. Right now, for example, the postage cost of mailing a
1-ounce, first-class letter is $.33. And soon, it's going to be $.34 and more. And, when you use direct mail, there are many
other expenses besides postage. For example, you've got to pay for printing, list rental, envelopes, folding, stuffing and
sealing and so on.

What this all boils down to is that it's going to cost you about $.60 (or more) for every piece of direct mail advertising you
send out even if you mail bulk rate.

Now, let's suppose you have a real estate business here in Los Angeles and you want to mail a sales letter to everyone in
your trading area. O.K., if your real estate business is located on Sunset Blvd. near my office, that means you will probably,
just for openers, want to mail everyone who lives in the zip code (90069) where your business is located.

Also, if your first mailing is successful, you'll probably want to expand your mailings to include everybody who lives in the
zip code areas that are adjacent to 90069.

Anyway, to get started, let's say you contact Mailing Lists of Southern California and you discover there are 57,128 people
living in zip codes 90069, 90068, 90046 and 90210.

Let's see now, at $.60 apiece, it's going to cost you $34,276.80 to make just one mailing to all these people!


Hmm. There must be a better way, right? Well, there is. Your first step is to contract other, non- competing businesses in
your trading area and you say to each one of them, something like this:

"Look, Mr. Druggist. As you know, the cost of direct mail advertising is sky high so I've got an idea.
Listen: What I'm trying to do is to get 10 different businesses to get together and share in the costs and the
benefits of a "co- op" mailing."

"What's a co-op mailing?" asks Mr. Druggist. "Well," you explain. "It's very simple. What happens is
everybody gives me their advertising flyer and I'll mail them all in one envelope and the costs will be
evenly divided among all the different businesses. That way, instead of it costing you $34,276.80 to mail
everybody in your trading area, it's only going to cost you in the neighborhood of $3400.00 which is a
savings of over 90%!

Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, it is a good idea but, you've got to be careful. The first thing you've got to do is make sure
that none of the participating businesses are in competition with each other. And, the second thing you've got to do is make
sure your direct mail message stands out, head and shoulders above all the rest.

Fortunately, that's easy.

You see, many of those businesses will have their advertising prepared by a local ad agency and it will be terrible. The
problem here is that most people who work for ad agencies only know how to "be creative" and win awards and not how to
create direct mail that sells. The rest of your "co-passengers" will probably create their advertising themselves and, while
that's better than hiring a moronic ad agency, they still won't have the special, inside knowledge and know-how you're going
to enjoy as a subscriber to my newsletter.

So, what this means is most of the people in your mailing co-op are going to be mailing, coupons, announcements of a
special sale, a brochure that explains what hours they are open and so forth.

Not you. No Sir. See, at this point, a light bulb is going off in your head and you are remembering what you read in that
other free report about what to write on a simple postcard mailing that will make people flood into your business.

Remember? Remember how I suggested you write something that gets people to call and listen to a free recorded
announcement that will entice them to call you or come to your place of business? You do remember? Good! And, since
you're in the real estate business, you have a bunch of cards printed up that say something like this:

FREE RECORDED MESSAGE REVEALS AN AMAZING SECRETTHAT LET'S YOU BUY L.A. REAL ESTATE WITHOUTPAYING HIGH INTEREST RATES OR A BIG DOWN PAYMENT!
Call (213) 000-0000 anytime, 24-hours a day.

And, of course, what you do is you have all your little "free-riding" postcards put in all those envelopes

with all the other dumb advertising and your message gets a "free ride" to everybody in your trading area.

Another tip: Since everybody else will be using color, your message will stand out if it's in simple black and white.

Now, of course, once you get this program really cranked up and you are making mailings perhaps once every month, you'll


want to send different messages. But, don't worry. My newsletter is going to give you more good advertising ideas than
you'll ever be able to use!

Does all this sound like a lot of work to you? Well, actually , it's not. True, there is a little effort to get this set up the first
time but, after that, all you have to do is telephone everybody every month and tell them what the deadline is to have their
material delivered to the lettershop.

And, if you are really a go-getter, why not get 50 local businesses involved with this idea and send out five different
mailings every month. Therefore, since you'll be the organizer and don't have to pay like everybody else, your sales message
can get a "free ride" in 100,000 mailings every week.

Or more!

Listen: I personally know of several people who have organized co-op mailings that go out in the millions every month.

So, if you've really got the ambition, working up to 100,000 letters a week should be a snap. So try it. And remember:

Nothing will work if you won't!

Section #10(This section contains the complete text of the 6/5/87 issue of The
Gary Halbert Letter.)

How To Use 976 Numbers To Get People To
Pay To Hear Your Sales Pitch!

Let’s talk about sex.

A few years ago I was browsing in a Studio City bookstore when the devil made me pick up a girlie magazine
called High Society. The devil then further directed my attention to the middle of the magazine whereupon he
forced me to examine the centerfold of the month in minute detail.

Thank God for the devil.

Anyway, there she was, all, spread out in her nude, nubile glory, beckoning me to feast my eyes on every square
inch of her lush, wanton, young body. But that’s not all she was beckoning me to do. No, Sir! She was also
beckoning me to call her at a special 976 number so I could hear her passionately profess how much she wanted
my body.

And so I did.

And so did a few other people. In fact, if my info is correct, some of those centerfold ladies receive...

500,000 CALLS PER DAY!

Whooee! That’s a lot of heavy breathing, ain’t it?
But, so what? What ramifications, if any, does all this have to do with our marketing efforts?

Plenty. Just wait. Now listen, do you know how this business of 976 numbers works? It’s sort of like this: What
you do is you go to Ma Bell and tell her you want to have some 976 numbers. Then you arrange to buy or lease
some phone answering equipment. All this will cost you a few thou. O.K., after you’ve got all this in place, what
you do is you run ads or mail letters or somehow entice people to call your 976 number to hear a recorded


message.

The numbers go something like this: First, the customer (he who does the dialing) must pay his normal phone
charges. What this means is that if your 976 number is located in the 212 area code and he is calling from area
code 213, then he must pay a long distance toll charge. However, if he is calling from the same area code, there
is, of course, no long distance charge.

Further-more, he must also pay a fee (usually about $2.00) for the privilege of listening to the info on the 976
recorded message.

And what happens to this $2.00 fee? Aha, I thought you’d never ask. Hear this: The fee is collected by Ma Bell (it
is added to the caller’s phone bill) and Ma keeps about $.50 of it and sends the rest (about $1.50) to you!

Getting interesting, isn’t it?

Let us press on. Remember that centerfold girl who invited me to call her so she could tell me how hot she was
for my bod? Do you want to know what she told me after her recorded message got me all hot and bothered?
Well, listen to this! What she told me at the end of her recording is that, if I wanted to talk to her live and, if I had
a credit card, I could call another number arid I would have the hottest conversation of my life!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

Hold on, all. ye who would think ill of me. I’m not getting excited about all that heavy breathing; I’m getting
excited about those numbers!

Let’s see now, if some of those centerfold girls get 500,000 calls per day, that’s, uh, about $750,000.00 to he
who owns the 976 numbers. And I wonder how many of those people with credit cards get excited enough to call
and talk to a live girl? What do you think? 20%? 10%? 5%? Naw. That seems too high to me. Let’s base our
numbers on a 1% “conversion”.

So, 1% of 500,000 is 5,000. Right? And what does it cost a credit card holder to listen to a real live girl talk dirty?
Well, according to my informants, it’s about $35.00 for 15 minutes. And how much is $35.00 times 5,000 callers?
Check it out. It seems to me it’s another.

$175,000.00!

By now, I bet you want to know more about this 976 business, don’t you? But you’re probably just like me. In
other words, even though you’d like to know how to apply all this to your own efforts, you don’t want to call one of
those “dial-a-porn” numbers by mistake, now do you? And so, as a public service, I, Sir Gary of Halbert, am
hereby providing a list of numbers in the 213 area code you must avoid dialing at all cost. Therefore, no matter
what, I implore you....

DO NOT CALL THESE NUMBERS!

Remember....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Whew! I’m glad that’s out of the way! Anyway, now that we know what not to do, how can we cash in on this 976
business for our own, more respectable business endeavors?
Hmn? How about this? How about if we are selling real estate in the L.A. area and we run a little ad in the Los
Angeles Times that says....

HOW TO BUY L.A. REAL ESTATEESTATE AT DIRT-CHEAP PRICES!
Call (213) 976—0000 foramazing recorded message.
$2.00 plus toll, if any.

Then, when the caller calls, we give him some accurate and valid tips on how to buy L.A. real estate and, at the
end of the recording, we give him our regular office number to call if he wants more info.
Did you like that one? I thought you would. By the way, (213) 976-HOME is a number that is safe to call in the
L.A. area. You’ll get a recorded message that will give you up-to-date info on L.A. area proper ties that have
recently gone into foreclosure.

What else? Let’s see. How about this? How about if Sir Gary, the Ravin’ Maven of Marketing, runs an ad in the
business section of various publications that says something like this....

HOW TO PROMOTE YOUR BUSINESS
FOR LESS THAN $1,000.00!
Exciting recorded message
by world’s best copywriter reveals amazing secret!
It’s only $2 + toll, if any. Call (213) 9 7 6 — G AR Y.


Whad’ya think? Will that one fly? Maybe I could change the message every week and many folks would call
week after week and some of them would become profit able clients or associates.

Hey! Come to think of it, maybe we could mail out the same copy on a postcard to lists of our best prospects!

Want more? I knew you did. Remember how I told you in an earlier letter that all of us are greedy, greedy,
greedy?

Don’t forget that. That concept can lead you down many profitable paths. Like this one: Suppose you are a car
dealer and you run an ad like this:

RED HOT CARS AT DIRT-CHEAP PRICES!
Incredible, recorded message revealshow to get amazing bargains.
Call (213) 976—C A R S. $2 plus toll, if any.

Or you’re a cosmetic surgeon and you run one like this:

NEW PLASTIC SURGERY TECHNIQUECAN MAKE YOU LOOK YEARS YOUNGER!
Amazing recorded message givesexciting details.
Only $2.00 plus toll, if any.
Call 9 7 6 - F A C E.

Or you sell stocks and you run an ad like this:

HOW TO PICK LOW-PRICED STOCKSTHAT ARE LIKELY TO DOUBLEIN THE NEXT 90 - DAYS!
Expert reveals exciting secret.
Call (212) 976—CASHFor amazing details.
$2.00 plus toll, if any.

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

Whatever. The point of all this is that there is now a relatively new and exciting way to get people to get people to
actually pay to hear your sales pitch!

But, let me offer a word of caution: When you promise an inside secret, you must deliver. Don’t ask them to call
you at another number to get what they have already paid for. That’s sleazy. And besides, it will turn people of f.
It will make them less receptive to dealing with you. Instead, if you are a real estate broker, give a really valuable
tip on your recorded message. Maybe you could tell the caller where and how to get a daily list of new
foreclosures. Tell him what to do, where to go, what to say, what forms he needs and whatever else would be
helpful. Then, after you have delivered you can tell him to call your personal number if he needs more info.

Listen: Advertising can work two ways. If you really are not a real estate or marketing expert, don’t promote


yourself. Hell, all you’re going to do is spend thousands of dollars to let people in on the fact that you’re an idiot.
(There’s a couple marketing news letters out there I’m sure glad I don’t have to sign name to.)

But look, if you’ve got some really good valid info you can deliver in a recorded message, you’ll position yourself
as a person who delivers and you’ll whet their appetite for more of the same.

Onward. I started this month’s issue on the subject of sex and, now that you’ve got me going, I think I’ll rave on a
little more. You know, I very seldom use sex in the advertising I create. I don’t know why exactly, I just never
have. But darn it, it sure seems to work. It sure seems to be the number one subject that occupies all of our
“Enquiring Minds.” Remember, in my issue on Haldeman-Julius’ Little Blue Books how, back in the 1920’s, the
number one subject people wanted to read about was sex?

Well, it’s the same today. Go to any big city magazine stand. Look at all those hundreds of magazines and you’ll
soon discover you can divide them into two, approximately equal categories:

SEX and then....everything else

And just look at this 976 number situation. I bet that 99.9% of all 976 calls are sex-related. You know, that’s sort
of a shame. Here’s a great new way to generate leads and a positive cash flow at the exact same time and
hardly anybody is using it except people selling titillation.

Another “sex story.” Once upon a time, I was introduced to a guy who claimed he was the greatest living income
tax expert in the world. I don’t know if he was or not, but I do know he went bankrupt not too long after I met him.
Anyway, this guy spent some really serious money in advertising in the Wall Street Journal and his ads usually
developed the theme of:

HOW TO PAYZERO TAXES!

Well, his ads were, I understand, fairly successful. And then one day, he got a picture of a beautiful, bosomy
blond from a local photographer and he used that picture in one of his ads. Her picture did not belong in that ad.
There was no connection between a sexy blond and a study course on how to reduce taxes. But guess what?

THAT AD WASTHE HIGHEST-PULLERHE EVER RAN!

You figure it out. By the way, this guy was a PhD (I hear that means “piled higher and deeper”) and he even
announced that fact on his vanity license plate. And, being a PhD, he never ran that ad again because he didn’t
feel it was consistent with his “image.”

Isn’t that a hoot?

Enough rambling. Let’s get back to this 976 business. You know, I believe this may be one of the hottest new
marketing phenomenons to come down the pike in recent years. So far, it’s mostly being used on the heavy
breathing crowd but, in my opinion, that’s going to change a bit. Today I was reading the classifieds in the L.A.
Times and I saw an ad that said this:


976-BIG MONEY MAKERWinning programs that attract millions.
Advertisements that pull thousands of dollars daily.
Sure success. 213/637—3781.

I called the number and talked to a woman who said she was Martha Tucker. She said her company helps
people get going in the 976 area and they are giving a seminar (admission price $10.00) at the L.A. Hilton near
the airport on June 20th. She also said her company offers a set of three tapes that reveal everything you need
to know to get in on the 976 bonanza. The tapes are $39.99 and they don’t take credit cards and, if you send a
check, they wait for it to clear before they ship. . I’m mailing them $40.00 cash today and I’ve asked them to
messenger the tapes to me ASAP. If the tapes contain valuable info, I’ll let you know in a future letter. In the
meantime, if you want more info in a hurry, you can contact them direct. Ask for Martha Tucker and you might
mention that I suggested you call.

The name and address of the company is:
INTERNATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS EXPOPOST OFFICE BOX 1006PARAMOUNT, CA 90723(213) 637—3781

Want more ideas? Lordy, you sure are a glutton for idea stimulators, aren’t you? Well, lucky for you, my youngest
son, Bond, has compiled a list of 976 numbers that are safe (relatively) for you to call that may give you some
ideas. You’ll find them listed where I normally write some inane P.S.

Sincerly,

On June 12 (my birthday), Paulette and I have decided to “skyout” for parts unknown. But don’t panic. We’re

UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!

The 976 info you just read in section #10 was written in June of 1987. Therefore, some of the phone numbers
are probably not good anymore.

Also, when I received the tapes I ordered from Martha Tucker, I was very disappointed and I cannot, in good
conscience, recommend that you buy them.

However, all the money—making ideas in section #10 are still very viable and the good news is...

YOU CAN NOW DO ALLTHIS PHONE STUFF ONA NATIONAL BASIS!

You see, in addition to 976, Ma Bell now offers a “900” service which is like a nationwide 976. All the great sales
ideas you just read in section #10 still apply, only now you can “go national” and not have to use a different
number for each city.

I’ll be writing an entire newsletter on this new “900” number option in the near future. In the meantime, you can
get more info from your long distance phone company and also from a magazine called “InfoText”. This
magazine is specifically geared to telephone information vendors and it will give you a great deal of help if you
are interested in this lucrative area. InfoText is located in Capistrano Beach, California and you can get
subscription details by calling (714) 493—2434. Ask for Bob Dale.

By the way, tell ‘em Guru Gary sent ya. Thanks.

SECTION #11

How To Make Your Ad In The Yellow PagesPull In 400% More BusinessThan It Does Now— At No Extra Charge!

Whenever someone opens the yellow pages, there are two things you can count on:

#1. That person is ready to buy.

#2. That person is undecided as to which establishment he should patronize.

O.K., let's suppose you are a chiropractor. Now, here in L.A., when I look under chiropractors I find there are 34 different
listings. And, out of those 34, 12 of those doctors have gone to the additional expense of taking out a display ad. Their ads
vary in size. The smallest one is 1-7/8 by 2 inches and the largest is 8 by 5 inches. Now, before I go on, I want you to look at
(and read) the 7 ads which I have reproduced on page 5.

Alright, you tell me. Is there anything in any of those ads that would make you 400% more likely to go to one of those
chiropractors instead of all the others?

I don't think so, either. And remember, these are the doctors who have paid extra for a display ad. The other doctors (the
ones who are merely listed and don't have an ad), are even worse off. All they can hope for is that their office happens to be
geographically closer to whomever is "letting his fingers do the walking" than the other doctors.

Not good enough. Let's see if we can do better. First, here is something you should remember:

RESEARCH HAS PROVENTHAT PEOPLE ARE 5-TIMESMORE LIKELY TO READWHAT IS (OR APPEARS TO BE)
EDITORIAL MATTER THANTHAT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLYAN AD!


And, here is something else for you to remember:

WHEN PEOPLE LOOKIN THE YELLOW PAGESTHEY ARE LOOKINGFOR A "SOLUTION."

In other words, when a person looks under chiropractors, he's not only looking for a convenient Doctor of Chiropractic, he's
also looking for a cure for his back pain, his migraine headaches or whatever. So, let's say our relief seeker, when he gets to
the section on chiropractors, not only sees all those "lookalike" ads, he also sees an "editorial" message that has a headline
something like this:

WARNING: DON'T CALLANY CHIROPRACTOR UNTILYOU READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT!

Or perhaps, like this:

DOES YOUR BACK HURT?
READ THIS BEFORE YOUMAKE A MISTAKE ANDCHOOSE THE WRONG DOCTOR!

Or this:

ARE YOU IN PAIN? IF SO,
CALL (000) 000-0000 AND LISTENTO AN AMAZING FREE RECORDED MESSAGETHAT REVEALS AMAZING WAYTO STOP HURTING FAST!

There is only one thing common about all these headlines and that is:

THEY ALL OFFERNEWS!

Now, the copy underneath those headlines must deliver on the promise in the headline. It should inform, educate and then
finally, give a compelling reason why the reader should choose the chiropractor who has written this "announcement"
instead of another doctor. And, not only is the message important, the format or the "look" of the message/ad can be crucial.

And how should it look? The answer to that one is simple.

 IT SHOULD LOOK LIKEA HOT NEWS STORY


TAKEN RIGHT OUT OF A NEWSPAPER!

Sort of like this:

WARNING: DON’T CALL

ANY CHIROPRACTOR UNTIL

YOU READ THIS!

Did you know that not all
chiropractors are the same?

Yes, it’s true. Some chiro-
practors only understandthe Palmer method of spinal
adjustment. While otherswho are more enlightened,
understand not only the
Palmer method but alsomany new techniques thatgive a more rapid and
complete relief to pain.

Do you hurt anywhere? Do
you have a chronic back
problem or a recurrent,
nagging headache? If so,
you should visit a chiroprac-
tor who uses the newpainless "accupressurewithout needles" mode of
therapy.

Why? The answer is simple.

You see, this new technol-
ogy can be used on yourvery first visit to reduce your
back pain (or headachepain) by 375% in just 15
minutes!

That’s the good news. The bad
news is that there areonly three chiropractors in
California who use this new
method of eliminating painand there is only one here in
Los Angeles.

So, if you need fast help, you
should call (000) 000-0000 and
make an appoint-
ment with Dr. R.J. Layton who
is the only doctor in L.A. using
this new "stop pain"
technology.

By the way, the first visit is
free.

Now listen: I just made that up. I really don't know much

about chiropractic. But, that's not the point. The idea is to get you thinking about what kind of "news release" you can write
that will give you the edge on your competitors.

Remember these points: (1) offer news; (2) offer a solution and; (3) if possible, offer something free.

And, most of all, don'tforget to have your


"news release" typesetso it looks like "news"
and not like an ad!

Remember all those ads from the phone book I showed you a few pages back? Well, let me show you how much more eye-
catching our "news release" is when it's set among these other "ordinary" ads. Look at page 6.

Really stands out, doesn't it?

Sincerely,

Gary C. Halbert

P.S. I was reading an excellent book called "True Detective" the other day and it reminded me of
something. The main character in the book was a private eye who worked in Chicago during the Capone
era. And, when he opened his little agency, he called it ACME DETECTIVE AGENCY or something like
that that started with an "A" so he could be listed first in the yellow pages.

If you can swing it, it's still a good idea.

SECTION #12
This section contains the complete text of the 7/1/88 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

How To Use Cheap LittleClassified Ads To Make As MuchAs $10,000 Per Day!

Let's all make some money!

As I told you last month, this month I'm going to tell you about a "remote control" mass
marketing technique that could easily double your income. I wasn't kidding. If you can't
figure a way to make some big bucks from the info in this issue then, my friend, we may
have to face the fact that, you are perhaps. . .

BEYOND ALL HOPE!

Aw, but that's not true, is it? Of course not! And, to tell the truth, I never suspected it
for a moment. In fact, in my judgment, since we already know you are smart enough to
subscribe to this letter, then obviously, all you need is a little nudge once in a while
(don't we all?) and a simple, easy-to-follow road map.

O.K., here's the road map; the nudge'll come later. What I'm going to do first is make
you aware of three important items of info and then I'm going to lash these three items
together so you can see how all this relates to an enormous profit potential.

So, to begin with, how many times have you read an ad or seen a direct response TV
commercial that said, somewhere in the copy, "Sorry, no C.O.D.'s?" Lots of times, right?
And no wonder. C.O.D. refusals are often very high (as much as 50%!) and sending stuff
C.O.D. is truly a hassle. It requires time, paperwork and, it costs extra money.

All in all, a lousy idea, right?

Hold the phone. Let's think this C.O.D. business through one more time. From a slightly
different angle. Let's say you're selling something that retails for around $60.00 for


which your wholesale cost is around $30.00. Now, let's say you do accept C.O.D. orders
and your refusal rate is a sky high 50% (which, incidentally, is very common). There's
no doubt about it: with these numbers, you don't have a chance.

But wait! Let's say we're selling a different kind of product. Let's say we're selling a
super product like the one I touted in the 12/5/87 issue of this letter. Remember what I
said back then? Remember how I said, "SELL SOMETHING YOU LOVE?" And also, how, if
you didn't already have a product, you should use the guidelines in that issue to create a
report that gives people valuable info for which they would be willing to pay
handsomely? Reports like "HOW TO SKI ANYWHERE IN THE U.S. AT HALF PRICE" or
"HOW TO LOSE 50 LBS. IN A NEW YORK SECOND" or "HOW TO STOP WRITING ADS FOR
A LIVING AND MAKE PEOPLE PAY YOU FOR SCUBA DIVING?"

Etc.?

Alright, let's say you are selling such a report. If so, it's probably going to cost you
about $.50 apiece to have them printed up, assuming you are doing any kind of volume
at all. Now, if we sent this report C.O.D. via UPS (United Parcel Service), we're going to
have to shell out another $4.11 in order to fill our orders. NOTE: This is figured on
sending our reports to the zip codes farthest from us.

So far, so good. Especially so, since we're going to charge $19.95 for our report.

PLUS $3.00 shipping and handling!

PLUS C.O.D. charges of $2.50!

For a grand total of $25.45.

Uh, let's see now, if it costs us $.50 to print our report and, $4.11 to ship it C.O.D., that
comes to $4.61 which, when divided into our customer's total cost of $25.45, gives us a
markup of 619%!

Aha, now we're talking! Shall we take another look at the math on that 50% rejection
rate? Let's. O.K., we ship 100 units at $4.61 apiece for a total outlay of $461.00. And,
half of those folks send us a message which, if acronymed, would be "E S & D!"

In other words, they refuse the package and we end up getting it back.

But the other 50% who did accept the package, and who

paid us $25.45 apiece for same, yield us a gross of $1,272.50.

Hmn? When we subtract our costs of $461.00 from our gross of $1,272.50, it seems to
me we are knocking down a hefty $811.50 gross profit...

ON EVERY 100 ORDERS


WE SHIP!

And, we can feel good about it too! Why? The answer is simple: You see, when people
buy info from us, they are not buying paper and ink -- they are buying answers!

And, they really don't care whether you pay $.50 to produce your reports or $50.00 or
$.05. Nope. What they really care about is. . .

DO YOU DELIVER?

Onward. Now, from the above figures, you can see that we'll break even if only 18 or 19
of every 100 orders we ship are accepted. Think about it. Think about the astonishing
fact that, (with these margins), as long as you collect at least 20% of the C.O.D.'s you
send out, at least you won't lose money on that part of your operation.

And think about this: There are lots of other products like vitamins, diet pills, cosmetics
and so on that have these kinds of margins!

And think about this: Offering to ship C.O.D. almost always dramatically increases your
pull!

And think about this: Ol' Guru Gary knows how (in most cases) to vastly increase C.O.D.
acceptances and he's going to tell you exactly how later in this letter!

But not now. Nope. Now it's time for me to move on to the second area of info upon
which I wish to expound. Namely: answering services with. . .

"ELECTRONIC MAILBOXES!"

Actually, all we're talking about here is answering services with "super duper"
answering machines. They work kind of like a monster version of your handy dandy
home answering machine. Like this: What you do is you run an ad to sell your report or
your diet pill or whatever and, in the ad (which only teases your prospect), you invite
said prospect to call the number assigned you by the answering service to hear a
harmless "non-threatening" recording with more info about your goods and/or services.

And so he does. And he (your prospect) hears a long recorded announcement that tells
him that your report (or pill or whatever) is the best thing since sliced bread and, that
to get it. . .

HE DOESN'T HAVETO SEND ANY MONEY OREVEN USE HIS CREDITCARD BECAUSE YOU,
IN ALL YOUR NOBLENESS,
WILL SEND YOURGOODS TO HIM C.O.D.!


Wowee! That sure removes all doubt as to whether you're really going to send the
goods, doesn't it? Oh yeah! O yeah! A sales message like this (properly done) positively
removes at least 90% of the anxiety that people often feel when ordering by mail from a
"stranger."

Want to hear how it's done? I knew you would. O.K., I've recently become aware of a
guy who's running a little "work-at-home" classified ad (stay away from this area, it's
FED BAIT!) and it has a phone number for the reader to call and when you call this
number you get his recording selling you on buying his work-at-home "guide" plus his
instructions to you on how you should leave your name and address so he can ship you
his guide via C.O.D.

Go ahead and call and listen. The number is (213) 259-6652.

(Editors Note: The above number is no longer active. We suggest you get a copy of
Small Business Opportunities Magazine, Home Business Magazine or similar magazine
and locate a similar ad and call the number.)

DO IT NOW!

Gee, I'm pushy, ain't I? Forgive me, I mean no harm. It's just that all the rest of this
letter will be clearer to you if you take a few minutes to hear a real "live" example of
how all this is done.

Remember, do not emulate what the guy who made the recording is doing. As I said,
he's working in a truly dangerous area. However, listening to his recording hopefully did
get your mind working as to how we can use this concept in other "less volatile" areas
of endeavor.

Plus, later on, I'm going to give you the number of another recording that was made by
a man who is known far and wide as a veritable "Prince Of A Guy!"

But that's later. For now, let's get back to this "electronic mailbox" idea. Let's assume
you've run your ad, or TV or radio spot (or billboard or whatever) and you've gotten
people to call your recording and you've sold them on letting you ship them your goods
C.O.D. So, what's next? Well, what's neat about the services that provide this "mailbox"
service is that you can, whenever you wish, call your mailbox and, by pushing a code on
your touch-tone phone, you can "empty" your mailbox.

In other words, you call and get the names and addresses of all your new customers
and then erase the tape and your mailbox sits there, all ready to be filled up again.

Listen: These things take multiple calls at the same time, they don't tie up your office
lines, they're cheap, they fix it so you don't have to buy or lease exotic answering
machines (at least until you've finished your testing and you're ready to "roll out" like
crazy) and, if necessary, they provide a bit of a "shield" for those of you who don't want
to waste time talking to dorko idiots.


Check around and see if there's one of these services in your area. If not, here's one in
L.A. you might want to use:

Enough. Let's move on to the third area of interest. A question: In all of Advertising
Land, what is the best advertising buy you can make, pound-for-pound, penny-for-
penny, dollar-for-dollar? Answer: Why it's none other than those little, itty bitty. . .

CLASSIFIED ADS!

consider this. . .

Hah! That got your ol' greed glands working, didn't it? Well, hang in there, my sweet
subscriber, cause you ain't heard nothing yet! Yea verily, it turns out that one of my
esteemed readers has done a remarkable thing. And, what has this man done, pray tell?
Simply this. . .

HE HAS PUT TOGETHERA NETWORK OF 3,806NEWSPAPERS IN 41 STATES WITH ACOMBINED CIRCULATION OF30,880,526 IN WHICHYOU CAN PLACE A 25WORD CLASSIFIED ADFOR LESS THAN $1.55PER PAPER!!!

Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!


Let's milk this sucker! The man's name who put all this together is Marvin Pursinger and
his phone numbers are:

FAX (206) 574-4671

FREE (800) 332-2730

PERSONAL (206) 574-4671

And, if that ain't enough, his TELEX number is 221 031 BRAD UK.

Now listen: If you want to place your classified ads through this man, you'll obviously
have to pay him for the privilege. But hear this: He's found a way to "network" the
placing of classified ads and he can do it on a dirt cheap basis and he can make a buck
even though...

HIS PROFIT IS ONLYSLIGHTLY MORE THANTHE $.25 POSTAGE ITWOULD COST YOU TOMAIL AN INSERTIONORDER TO EACH OF THESE PAPERS!

Here are some of the details on this highly unusual classified ad placement service:

1. This is the only national (or even state) program of brokerage on
classified ads. No one else has ever done anything like this.

2. This is the most unknown service in existence. Some of my subscribers
are the very largest users of classifieds in the world and neither they nor I
had ever heard of this service.

3. For speed, this classified ad business even beats direct mail. Ads received
in any given week are run the very next week. And, of course, since no one
saves newspapers, you know if you have a "winner" almost instantly.

4. This is the best test market God ever invented. The reason is that all copy
for each state each week must be uniform and you can make no changes of
any kind. However, 41 states means 41 chances to test as many as 41
different headlines or copy appeals each week!

5. NOTE: Most of these papers will not allow you to ask for money in your
classified ads and that means you must work a program similar to the one
described earlier in this letter.

You know, this is an ideal way to rather "quietly" entrepreneur a mail order type
enterprise and develop a hefty private income for yourself. On the other hand, if you


already own or operate a big business, there is still a way this classified area can be of
benefit to you and your company. Let's say you are JIMMY CALANO of Careertrack
(largest seminar provider in the world) and you are wondering if your new idea of
giving "WORKPLACE RE-ENTRY" seminars to women who have recently finished raising
their families is viable or not. Hmm? Could classifieds give you a clue? You bet! You
see,...

YOU CAN USE CLASSIFIEDTO TEST CONCEPTS!

I'll explain in a moment. But first, here is a list of the states in which this program is
available along with the circulation of the papers in those states:

And so on. Listen: This guy Pursinger has collected a ton of info on how to make
classified work and, if you become one of his national subscribers, he'll share this info

Update Update Update

The information you just read in Section 12 first appeared in my newsletter of 7/1/88,
therefore this section needs an update.

I need to remind you that all of the ideas are still good (exceptionally good) but, some
of the phone numbers may be out of date.

However, the biggest change of all is that Marvin Pursinger, has developed some
mental, emotional and physical problems and his classified network no longer exists.

But, do not despair, there is a "new kid on the block" who has put together a different
classified ad network and…

HIS CLASSIFIED NETWORK IS10 TIMES BETTER THAN MARVINSEVER WAS!


This guys name is Phil Kratzer and his company is NRC Media Services

SECTION #13
This section contains the complete text of the 12/1/86 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

How To Use RCS To FindYour Dream Lover!

Today I am going to begin the process of teaching you how to write copy. Not ordinary copy. Not
the kind of copy that is written by ad agencies. Not copy that is limp, boring, sodden and dull.

No. Today you are going to begin the process of learning how to write "killer" copy! Copy that
drags in not thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions or even tens of millions of dollars; but
rather, copy that has the potential of increasing sales for you (or your clients) that can add up to
hundreds of millions of dollars!

All in all, I dare say this will be the most interesting and exciting newsletter you will ever read on
this subject.

So, let's see if I can live up to that boast. Listen to this: In the last 30-days or so, my travel
schedule went something like this:

l Los Angeles to Las Vegas
l Las Vegas back to Los Angeles
l Los Angeles to London
l London to Brussels
l Brussels back to London
l London to New York


l New York to St. Louis
l St. Louis to Los Angeles
l Los Angeles to Las Vegas
l Las Vegas back to Los Angeles

In addition to (and in conjunction with) my travel schedule, I've been doing a little work:
Currently, I'm in the process of putting together a couple of cable TV shows with Hal Morris and
his daughter Debbie, I'm working on an account for a major health book publisher, I've
conceptualized and created a brand new numismatic promotion, I'm working with some of the
largest financial publishers on the planet, I'm working on a vitamin deal and a book publishing
venture with Barbara Cartland (the Guinness Book of Records says she's the most prolific writer in
the world) and, if Paulette's arithmetic is correct, something like 32 other major endeavors!

So what? What the hell does my travel and work schedule have to do with teaching you to write
dynamite copy? Well, remember how I said I was going to make this the most exciting thing
you've every read on the subject? I did not say I was going to "fit it in" did I? No, I said this issue
of this newsletter was going to be outstanding, didn't I? I didn't say you're going to have to settle
for a "second class lesson" because I'm so busy, did I?

No. What I am saying is that no matter what, I intend to make this newsletter outstanding.

And that's how I feel about everything I write. Every ad. Every direct mail letter. Every TV
commercial. Every radio commercial. Everything. And so, my friend, if you've been paying
attention, you should have already guessed the most important thing you can have when it comes
to writing great copy which is....

A "FIGHTER PILOT" ATTITUDE!

Of all things that contribute to copywriting success (and success at any endeavor for that matter),
the most important by far is attitude. An attitude that says that you will do (within the bounds of
good taste and legality) anything that is necessary to make the work you are doing for yourself or
your clients a success. No excuses. No missed deadlines. No half-assed work. No "throwing it
together." No nothing except for your very best.

NOT EVER!

So much for ingredient #1. Now let's get into ingredient #2. Recently, I did a direct mail package
for Brian Smith whose "Personal Finance" newsletter is the largest circulation hard money
newsletter in the world. That package included an 8-page letter which took me five weeks to write
to get it to the point where I was satisfied with it. As a matter of fact, I did 23 drafts of the first
page alone.

And thus, we have a prime example of ingredient #2 which simply is....


HARD WORK!

Most advertising is written by guys who think they are "creative." I am always amused (somewhat
sourly) by copywriters who explain how they get their marketing inspirations while working in
splendid isolation somewhere in the woods of New Hampshire or while tramping some lonely
beach north of San Francisco or in some other God-forsaken place where there are no "people"
around to interfere with the wondrous flow of their creative juices.

Oh gosh, it doesn't seem to work that way with me. I get insights and ideas from going out
amongst the market. And what is the market? You know, it seems to me that the "market" is
people. Want to know where I learned to sell? And, in fact, where anybody who really knows how
to sell also learned how to do it? Most "creatives" would never guess because where I learned
was....

IN THE WORLD

Yes boys and girls, I've been a door-to-door salesman, an MP, a prison guard, a prison inmate,
owner of several corporations (one employed 700 people), a publisher (of books, newsletters,
etc.), a scuba diver, a fool, a fraud, a savior, an idiot, a hero, a parent, a lust-crazed salivating
degenerate (I still am); I've worked with movie stars, morons, Machivellian manipulators, saints,
sinners and so forth and I say this unto ye:

"Do not ever trust (or hire)
a copywriter who isnot of this earth!"

Whatever. Let us now, at long last, begin to get specific. I am now about to tell you the true story
of how I wrote the most successful ad that was ever written. By reading this amazing little saga,
you are going to learn several of those ingenious and essential ingredients that all of your ads
must contain if you want them to be truly spectacularly successful!

Now for the story: One upon a time, back in 1978, I met and began dating an exceptional and
delightful young lady who lived in Santa Monica. At the time I met her she was one of those
women who was so pretty it almost hurt your eyes to look at her face. She had an executive
position with a company that produced custom-designed aquariums, a sparkling personality, a
neat, sexy little body, a good sense of humor, many useful talents and skills, and, on top of all
that, she was even a gourmet cook. Actually, all in all, to tell the truth, she was pretty much
everything I ever wanted in a woman.

Or so I thought.

Unfortunately, my little Teresa (not her real name) also had a major problem with her self-esteem
and, over the next few years, I noticed she would never let things get "too good." In other words,
what she would do is, whenever we got dangerously close to financial or emotional prosperity, she
would find some way to trash everything so we could get back to that morbid level of existence


where she knew "we belonged."

There's a lot of people like that, both women and men, aren't there?

Whatever. In any case, this was really frustrating and, finally, after putting up with this nonsense
for a lengthy period of time, I couldn't hack it anymore and Teresa and I drifted apart and I
started dating other women. At first, this was really exciting. However, after a while, it got to be
seriously depressing. You see, the women I started dating all looked good on the outside but, after
I got to know them, many of them seemed to be mentally deranged, emotionally crippled,
delirious with drugs or, perhaps, just plain airheaded.

So I went back to Teresa.

And I tried once again to make it work. I tried hard. No luck. Teresa still couldn't handle
prosperity. Her inner miasma magnet was still in excellent working order and, once again,
whenever things started getting too good, she would do something that would alter the course of
our lives and head us right back in the direction of the nearest emotional swamp.

No good. After a few months, I once again gave up the struggle to make this contorted
relationship work and, once again, Teresa and I split up.

But this time it was for keeps. I just couldn't bear the idea of ever getting back together with
Teresa and cranking up the same old misery machine. I also couldn't bear the idea of dating
another collection of women only to discover they were all losers, lame brains, or drug addicts.

So what did I do? Very simple. I did without.

Yes, good friends, it is sad but true: For months and months and months poor old pitiful, feeling-
sorry-for-himself, semi-handsome Gary never had a date. Not one. I filled my life with work. And
watching TV reruns of "My Mother the Car." And going to movies. And taking long walks thinking
semi-profound thoughts on the meaning of life. And so on.

And, eventually, after starting work on a manuscript called "Gary's Guide to Creative Sexual
Abstinence" and, after finding myself slaving over a chapter titled "14 Fun Things to Do With
Rutabega," I knew I was losing it. I knew I had to do something to change the direction of my
life or else I was going to go crazy.

So guess what? I wrote an ad.

And, it is this ad that I consider to be the most successful ever written. And, also, the best one I
could ever choose to use as a "teaching model" to dramatically illustrate some of the in-print
selling techniques that I consider critical. And now, my friend, I'm going to ask you to do
something. What I'd like is for you to get yourself a cold beer, a cup of coffee, a soft drink or
whatever you feel like having and then settle down in a nice comfy bed or chair and open up that
ad (it's enclosed with this letter) and then very carefully read every word of it before you continue
reading this newsletter.

Please do it now.


O.K., have you finished reading the ad? If not, you have cheated yourself because the rest of this
newsletter won't be as clear to you as it could be. On the other hand, if you have read the ad, I
want to issue a word of caution. It is this: you were probably amused by that particular ad just as
you are, I suspect, sometimes amused by this newsletter. That's fine. However, do not deceive
yourself that, just because my writing sometimes has "entertainment value", that, at the same
time, that same writing is not serious.

I'm always serious about my work! Serious as cancer. And, the ad you just read was, without
question the most "serious" ad I've ever written. Think about it:

Other than your health, what in the world could conceivably be more important, than finding the
ideal mate with whom to spend your life?

And now, before I go into a somewhat clinical discussion of why that ad was so successful, I want
to tell you just how successful that ad was in order that you can more fully appreciate just how
important (and rewarding) it can be to get all the elements of an ad just right.

So how successful was that ad? Gosh, I thought you'd never ask!

First, even though it wasn't intended to be a "commercial" ad, it would appear that this "personal"
ad may be destined to become a great financial success because, as I told you earlier, (in the "Hot
Flash" pink sheet that was included in my newsletter promotion), seven rather interesting things
have happened in connection with this ad. Namely:

(1) It has been featured on L.A.'s largest radio station (KABC) five times.

(2) I have had two offers to write a book about the ad.

(3) I have had two offers to make a movie about the ad.

(4) I have, as a result of this ad, been introduced to and have dated the absolute
hottest women in Los Angeles.

(5) And, after tiring of the activities mentioned in item #4, I have, because
of this ad, settled down with a wonderful, gorgeous redhead who is the love
of my life and, in my opinion, the finest woman on planet earth.

(6) As I write this, I have just been asked if I will agree to a TV interview about the
ad here in L.A. on channel 9.

(7) And finally, I am now getting paid to write an ad about the ad!

Well, it would appear that all that was just the beginning because, since back then, It would now
seem that I am about to do my own (at least I'll own part of it) TV show built around that ad!

So, friends and neighbors, if I've got your attention, I now want to disect the elements that made


this ad such a great success and which must be present in any ad if it is destined to be a truly
spectacular winner. Here are a few comments about some of those elements:

PASSION: Most ads and direct mail letters are written by people who do not appear to be excited
about what they are writing. I'll never forget a certain insight I got out of a book called "The
Writer's Handbook" that I read many years ago. To wit: "Most writers think their writing is for too
dramatic when, in fact, it is not nearly dramatic enough."

As Claude Hopkins pointed out: "People will not be bored in print!"

Therefore, when you write an ad or DM promotion - go for it, damn it! Let your excitement and
enthusiasm spill out all over the page. Don't hold back. Put that pen to the page and RAVE! Rave
about your product, how great it is, how it will benefit the user, how it feels good, looks good,
smells good, works good, how it makes you feel better, look better, how it will make you richer,
healthier, thinner, more productive, more charming and so forth.

You know what new clients say to me all the time that is always wrong? It is this: "Yes, but my
customers are different. They're not like those people who read the National Enquirer or buy stuff
through the mail to look younger or lose weight on make a lot of money."

HOGWASH!

Everybody is like "those" people who read the National Enquirer.

Including you.

Including me.

I don't care if your market is lawyers, MD's, rocket scientists, architects, members of high society
or whatever...they will respond to passion. Passion is the #1 most missing ingredient in
advertising today. Everybody seems to be more concerned about offending a few losers than they
are about selling a multitude of winners. Who the hell cares about that small percentage of
cowards who have nothing but time on their hands and who write caustic (and unsigned) letters in
response to almost every solicitation they receive? I know I don't. But you know what? There are
hundreds of companies in direct response who give up millions of dollars in sales every year just
so they won't offend a small percentage of scumbags who will never buy from them anyway.

Listen: When you write copy you should never lie, never over exaggerate, never use poor taste,
never be vulgar, never insult your reader's intelligence but you should also....

STOP WORRYING SO MUCHABOUT OFFENDING PEOPLE
AND START WORRYING MOREABOUT SELLING THEM!

You know, there were a lot of fat, ugly, "loser" women who didn't like my ad but, boy oh boy, you
should see the ones that did like it. You see, when I wrote that ad,


I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT OFFENDING THE "DOGS"
INSTEAD, I CONCENTRATED ON SELLING THE "FOXES."

Heh. Heh.

DETAIL: Hardly anybody puts enough detail into their promotions. Remember this: People who
are not interested in your product or service don't want to know anything about it but, those who
are interested, want to know everything about it. Here is a good way to think about writing an ad:
imagine that there are 10 new cars coming out next month and that you have to spend $40,000
to buy one of those cars "sight unseen!" Imagine that you can't even see a picture of the cars!
Now tell me, how much detail would you want included in the ads about those cars before you
wrote your $40,000 check?

Would you be satisfied with a few vapid generalities like: "It really looks great and it gets good
gas mileage too!"?

I bet not. I bet before you shelled out your forty grand you'd want to know that that car got 23.7
MPG in the city on Chevron Unleaded and 31.4 MPG on the highway. I bet you'd want to know the
exact horsepower, how many coats of paint it has, how long exactly the warranty is good for, the
tread design of the tires and so on.

Listen: This principle is true, no matter what the unit price! When people buy by mail, they are
buying sight unseen and they want to know everything you can tell them, even if the article you
are selling costs $4 instead of $40,000. So, a good rule to remember is.......

WHEN YOU ARE SELLINGBY MAIL THEY WANT TO
KNOW ALL YOU CAN TELL!

Give it to them.

TRUTH ABOUT FLAWS: All products and services have defects. So do people. All of us are
flawed. (Even me). When I wrote my personal ad I didn't say I was 6'4", did I? I didn't say I was
"superstud", did I? I revealed a lot of stuff that made it very clear that I am a very imperfect
human being, didn't I? Well, you know what? When you admit to (and describe) your
shortcomings it makes you more believable when you talk up your good points, doesn't it?

Face it: Your product or service has flaws also.

Admit them.

CLARITY: The hallmark of all good writing is clarity. You do not necessarily achieve clarity by
throwing in a lot of details and being specific. Your ads can be very detailed and very specific
without being clear. Clarity is achieved by writing in an idiom in which your audience is
conditioned to understand. Most writers write as though they would never be able to guess what
idiom most of the people in America understand - which is....


EVERYDAY ENGLISH

Listen: the phrase "I'm sick as a dog" may not be very original or very "creative" but it sure as
hell is very clear, isn't it?

Pay attention; here is a thought that will surprise you:

MOST WRITING TODAY DOES
NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH CLICHES!

Sick as a dog. Fat as a hog. Poor as a churchhouse. Pretty as a picture. Slow as molasses in
January. Dumb as an ox. Hot as a firecracker. Crazy as a bed bug. Out of the frying pan and into
the fire. And so on.

Like I said, maybe those phrases aren't original; maybe they aren't creative but.....

THEY SURE AS HELLARE CLEAR AS A BELL,
AREN'T THEY?

Here's an important little trick: always read your copy aloud. By doing so, you will discover those
little glitches and bottlenecks that slow down or stop the flow of your message.

Want to know an even better way to use that little trick? Once upon a time I used to live in
Massillon, Ohio and I hung out in a place called Mike's Bar. Most of the people in Mike's were
prospects for the kind of books and products I was selling back then. Stuff like books on how to
collect government benefits you have coming and so on. So anyway, what I would do is take my
ads down to Mike's Bar and read them to the guys there.

Now listen to this: If the response I got was, "Gee Gary, that sure is a good ad; you write real
good!" then I knew I had a loser.

On the other hand, if my audience offered no comments about the ad whatsoever but instead
asked....

Gee, I'd like to have that book.
Can you get me a copy?"

Then, of course, I knew I had a winner.

But the worst response of all was, "Would you run that by me one more time? I'm not sure what
you're getting at." You see, that meant I hadn't worked hard enough. It meant that my sentences
and paragraphs were too long. That I wasn't writing in everyday English, that (usually) I hadn't
bothered to read the ad aloud to myself before I read it to them.

Look, people aren't dumb; it's just that they can't be bothered to "demystify" what the hell you
are trying to say.


And now for a "cliffhanger." I'm sorry but, at the moment, I'm running out of time, space, energy
and what little sanity I have left. Therefore, I'm going to save the most important (by far!)
technique of all for next months letter where upon I will devote the entire issue to it.

Don't miss it!

Sincerely,

Gary HalbertIn-print Salesman

P.S. Say, how do you like this newsletter so far? It's not much like the Friday Report, is it? By
the way, I'd love to get a letter or phone call from you and hear your comments. Would you be
willing to do that for a bribe? How about if I enclose a picture of Paulette who is the best of the
best of all those who answered my personal ad? Would that do it? What's that? You say you've got
to see the picture first?

What a hard case you are! O.K., you've got a deal. I’ve reprinted one on the very last page of this
report.

SECTION #14

How To Get YourselfOr Your ProductFeatured On Cable TVAt No Cost Whatsoever!

Over the last year or so, I have been influential in putting together 7 different 1/2 hour cable TV shows that have grossed an
aggregate of more than 14 million dollars!

Here's an example. Do you remember Jake LaMotta? At one time he was the middleweight champion of the world and the
movie "RAGING BULL" starring Robert Deniro was based on his life.

Well anyway, he and his wife Vikki have been divorced for a long time now and Vikki LaMotta has her own cosmetic
business. She's a gorgeous woman and she's the oldest woman ever to pose for Playboy Magazine. She looks great, she's got
an interesting life story and according to my girlfriend, Paulette. . .

HER COSMETICSARE GREAT!

So, as it turns out, I'm in Manhattan on a business trip and I happen to meet the executives who run Vikki LaMotta
Cosmetics and I get to talking to them about doing a cable TV show. And, to make a long story short, before long, they were
on the air with a show that ran on several national cable networks for more than eight months.

And It Didn't CostThem A Cent!

Would you like some of this action? If so, and if you can come up with what I call the three "S's," there's a good chance that
you too can have a have a hot cable TV show. Here's what's needed:

"S" #1: A Star: Someone who is an authority on what the show is all about (real estate, lowering cholesterol, looking


younger, etc.) or a star in the form of a celebrity spokesperson like Art Linkletter or some other well-known person with
"marquee value."

"S" #2: A Story: Something we can talk about in a TV interview format like "how I went from rich to poor by becoming a
chicken farmer" or "how I learned to buy real estate with no money down" or maybe, "how I lost 200 pounds and lowered
my cholesterol level more than 150 points." ETC.

"S" #3: A Solution: This is the most important "S" of all. Does your product or service solve a problem such as poverty,
hemorrhoids, obesity, boredom, hunger or the need to be rich and famous?

So, are you marketing something that has all these elements? If you are, stay tuned because this report is going to open your
eyes and, perhaps, a whole new window of opportunity for you.

First, some background. Listen. Cable TV is big. In fact, if it hasn't happened already, it will soon come to pass that more
people watch cable TV than broadcast TV. And, what this means is that cable TV networks and independent cable stations
are virtually starving for programming.

However, even though it's changing, right now, most quality programming goes to the big broadcast networks which are
ABC, CBS and NBC. But, who or what is going to fill all those big holes in cable available time known as "avails."

ENTER THE ENTREPRENEUR

What's happened is that many cable stations now, instead of paying some independent producer for the rights to broadcast
his game show are, instead, getting paid to air certain programs that were created by self-serving entrepreneurs. The way this
works is the entrepreneur will create a 1/2 hour TV "talk show" that interview a real estate guru who explains how he
learned to buy real estate with no money down. Then, during the commercial breaks, instead of selling TV spots to soap
companies or something, the entrepreneur uses that commercial time himself to sell something related to the subject of the
show.

Like, for example, a home study course with audio cassettes and written material created by the "star" of the show which
will teach you how to buy real estate with no money down.

Now pay attention to this: These shows won't work unless they have a unique angle and/or some news value to them. In
other words, if you own a car lot and you want someone to do a show about you just because you want to sell more cars, you
can forget it. On the other hand, if you have discovered a way to buy "cocaine Cadillacs" that have been confiscated from
drug dealers and, you can teach others how to do the same and get real bargains. . . Well, that's a different matter.

See, what you could do in a case like this is create a set of eight audio cassettes along with some written instructions that
will show others how to do it. Then, what you do is contact someone (like me) who is interested in new TV ideas and, if that
person likes the idea, he may very well put up all the money and expertise to make it happen.

Here's how it might work. You talk to a producer and, if he's interested at all, you send him your cassette course. Then, the
producer will outline the show, arrange for a camera crew and studio time and tell you when to show up at the studio. When
the show is taped you will be interviewed by an expert TV host who will ask you questions designed to draw out the
interesting story about how you learned to buy all these confiscated vehicles at dirt cheap prices.

Then, during the commercials, a professional announcer will extol the wonders of your cassette course and tell the viewers
they can get in on all this hot action by calling a toll free 800 number and using his or her credit card.


Now, let's say the retail price of your cassette course is $195.00 plus $3.50 for shipping and handling. O.K., what will
happen when the orders come in is the producer will keep about $140.00 of the money and give you the other $59.50 from
which you must fill the orders.

And, supposing you can fill your orders for less than $30.00 that means you net $20.00 on every order.

WITH NO RISK!
NO INVESTMENT!
AND VERY LITTLE HASSLE!

Where do you find these producers? Actually, I am connected to several of them, but I am deliberately not going to give you
their names and phone numbers in this report.

Here's why. These producers get pitched all the time and, very often, the pitch comes from someone who hasn't done his or
her homework. And, those people, all they do is burn your time. Usually, they haven't studied cable TV enough to have a
feel for what might work and, secondly, they are unrealistic about how valuable their "precious idea" really is.

Look: If you're really interested in this opportunity, what you do first is start watching a lot of cable TV "sellavision" shows
until you get a feel for the medium. Then after you're satisfied you may have something that will fit this format, you start
watching the "credits" at the end of the show. You also take note of the address given in the commercials. And, what you do
after all that is, you use that info to locate a producer whose show you like and you make your pitch.

Or, as an alternative you could contact me.

Say, but what if you don't want to split the loot with anybody else? Then, how much will it cost? Actually, it's surprising
how little if you take the time to learn the ropes. What it should cost you is roughly about $15,000 to put a 1/2 hour show in
the can and maybe another $5,000 to $10,000 to buy enough air time to test it.

And, how much can you make? The truth is staggering. You see, if you do this right, you might, like some of my other
newsletter readers. . .

GROSS UP TO 26 MILLIONPER YEAR.

Think about it. Give it your attention.

Sincerely,

Gary C. Halbert

SECTION #15
This section contains the complete text of the 2/6/88 issue of The Gary Halbert Letter

The Dark Side Of Success!

I'm in danger.

This is really true. It's not an opening statement I'm using for shock value. No. It's not a joke either. Or a clever prelude to a
marketing lesson. The alarm bells in my head are clanging and shrieking, stridently demanding attention.

Why? Listen: I've been on an especially hot roll lately and it's starting to go to my head. For one thing, I've just produced my
first TV show (it's about the Beverly Hills Medical Diet) and I think it's a very good first effort. For another, I've just beaten
one of my old direct mail control packages and now my client can profitably double his mailing schedule.

And he was already mailing700,000 pieces per month!

And so on. But, best of all, as far as my ego is concerned, I just received a letter from a man named Drayton Bird who is the
Vice Chairman of Ogilvy and Mather Direct in London. And, the reason that letter was so good for my ego is that he was
writing to tell me that he is in frequent telephone communication with David Ogilvy and that Mr. Ogilvy has just sent him
all back issues of my newsletter including what Mr. Bird refers to as the "brilliant" dollar bill acknowledgment letter. Mr.
Bird wanted to know, among other things, if he could include some of my work in the upcoming new edition of his book
called "Common Sense Marketing."

Well, I don't know about you but, for my money, David Ogilvy is easily the most astute advertising man alive and, to have
captured his attention through these letters is the prize feather in my self- serving war bonnet of ego accolades.

Except for the actual numbers that are produced by a good piece of marketing: those, of course, remain the supreme
accolade of your work.

Or else the supreme indictment.

Have you ever heard of the Caples Awards? John Caples is one of my marketing heroes, but the new wrinkle in the awards
given in his name makes me sick. You know what some slobs have decided about the Caples Awards? It's this: the direct


marketing piece in contention doesn't have to be a winner for the writer to win the award, it only has to be "creative."

Isn't that nice? It must truly cheer many a clients' heart, after being rendered damn near destitute by some fool's bird-brained,
stupid ad campaign, to know that the writer won the "Caples."

Shame on everybody connected.

Forgive me, I digress. Anyway, to get back to what I was saying, if you were to visit my offices and look around and talk to
the staff, you'd see pictures of me with some celebrities and clients, you'd see I have a loving and gorgeous woman, you'd
see framed letters on the walls from subscribers and clients I've helped make a lot of money, you'd see me working with my
children, you'd see all of us laughing and joking and having a good time while everybody works like crazy and, if you could
also read my thoughts, you'd see a man (me) dangerously close to making one of the deadliest mistakes a man can make
which is...

STARTING TO BELIEVEYOUR OWN PR!

This can be fatal. I'm not talking injurious to your business (although it can most certainly be that), I'm talking fatal, fatal.

Like once upon a time when it almost was for me. Listen: do you remember how, in my direct mail pitch, to get you to
subscribe, I promised to write about "the dark side of success?" Well, it's time for me to do that. Therefore, this letter is not
about how to improve your marketing or make more money. No, this letter is about how to keep your success from ruining
your life as it almost did mine. If you have children and/or anyone else you love and, if you think there is value in these
letters, this is the one, by far, that it would be the most important to let your loved ones read. What you are about to learn is
just how dumb, foolish and ignorant a supposedly intelligent man (Ol' "Guru Gary") can be. But let me suggest something:
before you smirk and get condescending about the stupidity I am about to reveal and say "that Halbert is really dumb, that
stupid stuff will never happen to me," I suggest you listen to that little whisper in the back of your mind that says. . .

Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.

Let us go back in time to the first half of 1973. Back then I was truly living high on the hog. I had sold my half-interest in
Halberts Inc. (the coat-of-arms company with over seven million customers) for a sum that translates in today's money to
something like 2 to 2-1/2 million dollars. I also had my publishing company (Good News Incorporated) cranked up to where
it was generating millions of dollars per year. I had highly profitable investments (sometimes my silver futures contracts
would appreciate as much as $20,000 per day), I had a showplace home atop a hill, a condo in Fort Lauderdale, a boat in the
Florida Keys, lots of hangers-on and, in general, I was...

A BIG FISH IN ALITTLE POND.

And believe me, I milked it for all it was worth. For example, whenever I found myself in a conversation with strangers and
the conversation turned to money and everybody was trying to impress everybody else, I would always emerge victorious by
using one of my conversational "toppers." Like so: if one of the group would ask me how much my income was, I'd say,
"Oh, about 20 thousand, I guess." And then they'd smile and say, "Well, that's not too bad. I guess $20,000 a year is decent
money for a young guy like you." And then, of course, I'd use my "topper" by saying. . .


Oh no, you misunderstood.
My income is $20,000 per day!

You like that one? Did it make you smile a little? Pretty clever, huh? Actually, what it really
demonstrated was my. . .

INSUFFERABLE STUPIDITY!

I'll tell you something: watch out for self-made guys in their 30's because many of them are just
as insufferable (and dangerous) to themselves and others as I was.

Another example. Once upon a time, the First National Bank in Massilon, Ohio wouldn't even let
me have a checking account because their credit research deemed me so unworthy.

Can you imagine that? A bank that says you're such a bummer they won't even let you deposit
money?

So guess where I did my banking after I made my big bucks? You're right. Right there at the good
ol' First National. And guess who, when the bank deposit was especially huge, made the deposit
himself?

Bingo. You're right again. Picture this: it's about two o'clock on a Monday afternoon. The door to
the bank opens and in walks what appears to be a young guy in his 30's who has been working on
a road gang. He's wearing faded and torn blue jeans, a sloppy sweatshirt and he's carrying a
canvas bag over his shoulder. He waits patiently in line and, when he gets to the teller, he tells
her he wants to make a deposit. And then in full view of all the customers in the bank and its
employees, this rather shabby-looking young man starts pulling out wads of checks and cash and
stack them side by side a foot or so high in front of the open-mouthed teller.

Sort of asking for it, wasn't I?

Well, I got it and it went down like this: One day in the first week of July, 1973, just after dark, I
went to get the groceries out of the trunk of the car. The car was outside the garage and, as I was
coming from inside the house, I had to push the button that would open the garage door
automatically. As soon as the door went up, I saw two figures standing outside the garage wearing
ski masks. At first I thought they were kids and I started to bitch. But the complaint died in my
throat as I discovered they were indeed adults and were both armed with .45 caliber handguns.
Have you ever seen a .45? I carried one for three years when I was an MP and they are scary.
Especially when you are looking into the business end of one of those monsters.

One of the guys marched me over to the air conditioner unit on the west side of the house just
outside the garage and had me take off my glasses and give them to him. Then, he did something
strange; he said to me very politely, "I'm putting your glasses here on top of the air conditioner so
they'll be easy to find when this is over."

Then he marched me back into my house where his buddy had already subdued my wife, Nancy.


Then they tied me up, blindfolded me, gagged me and put me inside a canvas sack.

They also did all this to Nancy except they didn't put her into a sack.

Then, they ransacked the house. They took our "emergency" silver coins, they took a cherished
heirloom ring that Nancy had been given by one of her favorite relatives and they took sacks of
mail all containing checks from our recent full page ad in Parade Magazine.

At this point, Nancy said, "Gary, do something! They're even taking the mail!"

But what was I to do while all tied up inside a canvas bag?

Anyway, they wanted more and they began to threaten us. However, after a while, they were
convinced there was nothing else to get and they left, taking my car (a Cadillac naturally) and all
the loot they had gathered up including thousands of checks written to Good News Inc. which
were worthless to them. By the way, before they left, one of them said, "This is what happens to
people who make a lot of money and who live in a big house like this."

Have you ever had anything like this happen to you? I hope not. It's unnerving and much more so
than you would think. You know, we're all so used to watching TV that we sort of get the
impression that, after a violent act, a person just gets up, brushes himself off and goes about his
business.

Trust me, it's not like that at all.

I'm no stranger to violence and danger. I grew up in a town that was, during my youth, the most
heavily industrialized per capita city on earth. I'm talking about Barberton, Ohio and, back then, it
was sometimes, almost like a war zone. In high school, my buddy, "Pompadour Bill," and I would
drive around in his father's car and we kept a German Luger and two knurled steel blackjacks in
the glove compartment. Then later, when I was an MP, I was sent to Germany and my tour of
duty consisted of breaking up massive bar fights and dealing with enraged servicemen and going
up against everything from pocket knives to a lunatic with a double-barrelled shotgun.

But this was different. This was in my home, my sanctuary, my cave that was supposed to be my
"safe place" and secure from the tigers and bears and demons of the night.

And my family was home!

Not only my wife, but my kids too, who were all (thank God!) asleep upstairs.

Anyway, for nearly a year after this, I could hardly sleep. I was already a heavy beer drinker back
then and, after the robbery, I began to drink even more heavily. My work suffered, my business
went downhill and I knew something had to change.

So, after a year, more or less, of living like this, I sold my business to a tall Texan named Jerry
Antill for $15.00 and never bothered to cash the check. By the way, at that time, the business had
over 1,000,000 customers and more than $60,000 cash-on-hand plus all its other assets.


What I did next is I moved my family to Los Angeles, California so my wife and I could become
patients of the Center for Feeling Therapy which was formed by a group of nine psychotherapists
who were formerly associated with the famed Institute of Primal Therapy formed by Arthur Janov.

The founders of the Center for Feeling Therapy were acclaimed worldwide. They were supposed to
be the best. They had been on 150 talk shows like Merv Griffin, Johnny Carson (I was in the studio
audience), Good Morning America and all the others. They published endless learned articles and,
I believe, four hardcover books. When Nancy and I signed up for this "therapy" it was our
understanding that in about nine months we would be relieved of all our mental trauma and we'd
be able to get on with our lives.

WHAT WE GOT INSTEAD WASA THREE AND A HALF YEARNIGHTMARE.

These so called psychotherapists, all licensed by the State of California, turned out to be the most
sophisticated and manipulative mind-benders the free world has ever known. They nearly ruined
the lives of hundreds of their patients. They were, (unknown to me at the time), sexually
molesting some of the female patients while they were sucking money out of all of us with an
efficiency that would've made even Jim Bakker envious.

They controlled your life. Everything from where you worked to where you lived and even to with
whom you could sleep.

Let me take a moment here to say that, at this point, you may be saying, "How could any
intelligent adult let such a thing happen? That could never happen to me." Well, what I say is you
only ask for therapeutic help when you are very vulnerable so. . .

Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.

By the way, all of those "therapists" were subsequently indicted by the California Board of Medical
Quality Assurance and they went through the longest malpractice trial in California history and
they all lost their licenses and were publicly shamed. If you are interested, you can read about it
in the September 30, 1987 edition of the L.A. Times.

But anyway, I didn't get out of that "therapy" until January, 1978 and while I was in it, my mind
was in virtually constant turmoil. And, while in the midst of this mental turmoil in 1976, I was
approached by a couple of guys who wanted to go into the mail order business. The idea was to
sell a book on "Proud Bi-centennial Americans" and also a decorative bi-centennial plate. The idea
was I'd write the copy and put up the money and these two guys would run the business. Well, for
a little while, things went fine. We mailed our sales letters, took in orders and started to produce
the products both of which, incidentally, had to be personalized.

Then, all of a sudden, everything went bad.

One of our big direct mail rollouts only produced a fraction of the earlier test results to that list.


Also, all my income from other sources, for reasons not relevant to this story, almost dried up
completely.

In a nutshell, what happened is we ended up with thousands of orders and not enough money to
fill them all.

This was certainly a bad situation but it was, I felt, at least correctable. You know, at that time, a
lot of people had come to know and respect me and I was pretty sure I'd be able to borrow
enough money to fill all the orders and make things right.

Alas, this was not to be. What happened next is that one of our customers who had not received
his order decided to complain and he did so to a local TV station. Well, as you know, the news
media is ever hungry for bad news and they sent a camera crew to our offices. The resulting
footage was not very dramatic but, when it was aired, we came to the attention of the postal
authorities and soon thereafter two postal inspectors came to our offices. Soon they learned that,
even though I wasn't the official owner of the business, I was, in fact, the "force" behind the
company.

Which was true.

So they wanted to talk to me.

So, not knowing any better, I invited them to my house.

Big mistake. Real BIG! You see, at that time I was living at 637 Pacific Coast Highway, right on the
beach in Santa Monica, California. My home was one of only 17 on that stretch of real estate (law
forbids the building of any more) and it was truly fantastic. The house next door to me was
formerly owned by Peter Lawford and it was the western White House when Kennedy was
president. I'm not going to go on and on about my house but I will say it was perhaps the finest
home I've ever seen. It had a 50 foot swimming pool and it later became the most expensive
home in history ever to be sold at private auction.

So, in come these two postal inspectors, one of whom I can hardly remember and the other whom
I'll never forget. The one I'll never forget was a tall, skinny guy with a scraggly mustache who had
a look of deprivation about him. In fact, to me, he looked like a guy who'd never had a good meal
or a good woman in his entire life.

And guess how he reacted to my home on the beach with its 50 foot heated swimming pool?

You know already, don't you? Let's just say he wasn't exactly overjoyed to see me enjoying the
evil fruits of my capitalistic endeavors. During that first meeting, and during subsequent ones, he
would slip in comments like, "Well, I guess I'll never know what it's like to live in a house like
this." Or, "I'm sorry to have to ask you and your wife to ride in this plain old car but we can't all
have Cadillacs."

And so on.

So it begins to look like this is really serious and it's not going to go away so my partners and I


hire a lawyer. I can't remember his name. Actually, I only chose him because he was so handy as
he was in the same building as our offices. After we explained everything to this lawyer he said it
was obvious that none of us ever had any criminal intent (true) and that we should open our
books and give the postal inspectors any info they wanted.

That was a big mistake. A real BIG mistake!

Look, being investigated is like being interviewed by a TV news team. In other words, if they find
out 50 good things about you and one bad thing, it is only the negative that is recorded on their
minds and has a chance of going on the air or in their reports.

We were indicted. All three of us. For mail fraud.

What happens next is the postal inspectors have a little chat with my two "co-conspirators" and it
is explained to them that if they help the inspectors get me (Mr. Big) that they will be allowed to
plead guilty to only one count of mail fraud and probably get a suspended sentence.

And, to their eternal shame, those two guys laid down and rolled over. And, in fact. . .

THEY WERE SO SCAREDTHEY PLED GUILTY TO A
CRIME OF WHICH THEYWERE INNOCENT!

Perhaps I'd better modify that "innocent" part a bit. According to the law, you are not guilty of any
type of fraud, including mail fraud, unless you had "criminal intent." Well, let me tell you, neither
those two guys (or me, for that matter) ever had one smidgen of criminal intent.

On the other hand, the mail fraud statutes are written so broadly it is difficult for anyone who has
ever mailed a letter not to be found guilty. It's so bad, in fact, that sometimes, it seems to me
that anyone who has walked by, driven past, or flown over a U.S. post office is guilty. What this
means is that, often, a jury does not have any real choice as to whether or not to find a defendant
guilty. You see, what happens is that the judge will issue jury instruction that dictates the jury
must find you guilty if such and such or so and so occurred.

And since those such and such's and so and so's are so broad in scope. . .

98% OF ALL DEFENDANTSARE FOUND GUILTY!

Here's a side story. Once upon a time, in the San Fernando Valley, some paid arsonist torched a
restaurant and a couple of people were killed. He was guilty of trespassing, breaking and entering,
arson and murder.

AND THEY GOT HIM
FOR MAIL FRAUD!


Cause somebody, to get the insurance payoff, sent the claim info by mail. And the prosecutors
know, if they can't get someone for something else, they can almost always get anybody for mail
fraud.

On with my story: So, here I am indicted for mail fraud and, in August of 1978, I went to trial. It
lasted about a week and guess what was the most persuasive piece of evidence the feds had
against me.

IT WAS MY HOUSE!

Yep. One of those zealous little public servants stuck a camera over the hedges on the beach side
of the property, took a picture, had it blown up to poster size and then forced the jury all week to
look at this photo of "Halbert's Beach Villa."

Know this: if you are a successful businessman, there is no such thing as a "jury of your peers."
Basically, your fate will be decided by 12 men and women who are "have nots" and who believe all
the "haves" got that way by being crooked.

I was convicted.

I was sentenced to 18 months but I was released on my own recognizance, pending appeal. The
appeal took three years and, guess what?

I WON!

The trial was, in my opinion, a farce and, unbelievably, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to
agree. Now what happens when you win an appeal is you are back to square one. What that
means is the government has the option of putting you on trial again, dropping the whole thing or
else letting you plead not guilty to a much lesser charge.

That third choice, the "plea bargain" is, by far, the most popular choice. And that is what the
government decided to do with me, to let me plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a fine or
something. You see, by this time, the "news value" of "The Big Bi-Centennial Rip-Off" was non-
existent and, after everything that came out in the 1978 trial, I think even the prosecutors no
longer thought I was such an evil guy.

But this was not to be. And, according to my lawyer, it was because that "from hunger" postal
inspector wouldn't let it go.

I don't know if that's true or not. But I do know this: the mental and emotional turmoil of being
"in therapy" and fighting these mail fraud charges caused me to go broke around the time of the
first trial. However, between 1978 when I filed my appeal and 1981 when I won it, I did
something unthinkable:

I MADE A LOT OFMONEY ALL OVER AGAIN!


And in 1981, when the postal inspector came out to serve me, I was then living at 201 Ocean
Avenue in Santa Monica and I owned two apartments there (they're co-ops) which were both
worth a ton of money.

Can't have that, can we? No Sir. So, in August of 1981 I go back on trial again. But this time I've
got a new lawyer (wait'll you hear about all my wonderful lawyers) and I'm a lot more prepared
and I think I'm going to win. The prosecution trots out the picture of the house again but,
anticipating this, my lawyer and I have prepared what we think are effective counter arguments.

So, the trial ends on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and when the jury walks past me, they
actually look friendly and that's a good sign says my lawyer. But the next morning as they walk
past me and my lawyer, their heads are down and they won't even look at me and that's a bad
sign says my lawyer.

And later, that afternoon, they find me guilty.

And, in an interview, what do they say as to why they found me guilty? "It's the house," they say.
"Anybody who was really trying to do right and fill those orders wouldn't have lived in such an
expensive house."

"But I thought we explained that," says my lawyer.

"Yeah, but just look at this article that is in this morning's Herald Examiner," says a lady juror.
And she waved it in front of our faces and there was a three page article all about my house
complete with pictures, the main one of which was the same one the jury had been forced to look
at poster size all week.

What a strange coincidence. Here it is something like six years since I've lived in this house and
the Herald Examiner which is a morning paper comes out with this long article about the opulence
of the house and its furnishings and all the Rolls Royces and other exotic cars parked outside and
so forth and it comes out just in time for the jury to see it. . .

AND TAKE IT IN THEJURY ROOM WITH THEM!

Incredible timing, right?

So we immediately ask for a new trial and I'll never forget the judge's face as he denies the
motion muttering how he may be wrong but we've got to make sure the appellate court has
enough work to keep them busy.

So once again I file an appeal and try to retain my sanity (I never did regain it) as I wait for the
outcome.

This time it only takes 2-1/2 years and I lose; I don't see how but I did.

And on May 21, 1984 I reported to Boron Federal Prison Camp ("Club Fed") in the Mojave Desert


to start serving my time. I'll tell you a little about that experience in a minute but first two more of
my semi-famous "side trips."

First, I want to tell you a little about the seven lawyers I used fighting this nightmare. One of
them was a respected law professor who wrote both of my appeals. Another was a Mormon who
fought his heart out for me but could not overcome the impact of the newspaper story about my
house. Another one did almost no preparation for my case and he was eventually disbarred.
Another one is the naive, young guy who told me to freely give the postal inspectors any info they
wanted. Another one was too busy laundering drug money to be of any real help to me and,
besides, he was found shot dead in the Century Plaza shopping center while clutching a paper bag
full of paper money. Another, reputed to be a "fix it" lawyer, was indicted along with a local judge
for obstructing justice.

I SURE CAN PICK 'EMCAN'T I?

The seventh attorney was Howard Weitzman. Remember him? He's the guy who won for DeLorean
and the only attorney in this story who I have decided to mention by name. You know, I really
have a lot of respect for this guy. Here's why: When I asked him to do some post-conviction work
for me he said. . .

"Gary, you ought to get someoneelse because other lawyerswill do it cheaper than me andyou don't have much of a
chance anyway."

I could hardly believe it; honesty from a lawyer? So I hired him, he gave it his best shot, I lost
and paid him willingly and never regretted it simply because. . .

HE WAS STRAIGHTWITH ME!

By the way, I talked to him on the phone from Boron the day after DeLorean was acquitted and I
told him that, when the verdict was announced, the whole camp burst into applause!

Isn't this a bitch of a story? Hold on. You ain't heard nothing yet. Let's take side trip #2.

Away we go. After my conviction in 1978, while I was on appeal, I did some work for a publisher
back east. What I did is I wrote a diet ad for him that featured a San Diego M.D. (a psychiatrist)
that became one of the highest pulling ads in history.

Considering my situation, I was very careful about what I wrote. I checked and double-checked
with the doctor to make sure the ad was accurate.

The money started coming in like crazy and the guy back east couldn't keep up with the orders. I
literally begged him to slow down, to stop advertising till he got caught up. To no avail. He got
thousands of orders behind, many of which were four months overdue. And guess what? Yep. He


got indicted, I got indicted and the doctor got indicted. . .

On an ad I thought was "hound's tooth clean!"

Those indictments were later dropped but they massively interfered with my mental peace and
also prevented me from bringing in character witnesses during my second trial.

Lord, love a duck; I was starting to feel like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.

But so what? What can be learned from all this that is of practical value to you?

A lot. Assuming you don't want to be robbed, incarcerated or swamped with the emotional and
financial trauma of litigation, I herewith offer 10 rules for your consideration:

#1. STOP LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD

Stuff like this really can happen to you. People who never take any risks are boring cowards but
people who take stupid risks are, in fact, stupid. Consider this: the news is full of stories about the
dangers of AIDS yet, by far, the #1 and #2 most common and preventable causes of death in the
U.S. are cigarette smoking and not wearing a seat belt. Yet millions of dummies still smoke and
ride around sans safety belts while mouthing banal quips about how everybody has to die of
something.

Trust me, Buckwheat, if you get lung cancer or permanently mangled and/or paralyzed in a car
crash, the memory of all those cute little banalities you used to say will make you vomit.

And so it is with taking unnecessary chances in your advertising campaigns. No one is in complete
control of his or her destiny but, for God's sake, don't beg for problems like I did. You'll get
enough problems no matter how careful you are without insisting on having more.

#2. STOP LYING!

To your customers, to your partners or business associates and to yourself. If you lie in your direct
mail letters and/or space ads or commercials, the one time you get caught may easily cause you
more grief than it was worth for the hundreds of times you slipped by.

And hear this: In the last 1-1/2 years I've met three different people who routinely cheat
everybody they do business with. Well, let me tell you, one thing I learned while serving time is
that not everybody who gets cheated elects to right that wrong via litigation. Instead, many
choose mayhem or murder. But you don't really believe any of those wimps you've ever
shortchanged would do anything like put out a "contract" on you, do you?

Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.
Don't be too sure.

#3. IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGE EVERY ORDER YOU RECEIVE VIA FIRST CLASS


MAIL!

Pound for pound and penny for penny, this is the most profitable point in all your communications
with your customers. But profit is not the issue here. No. The issue here is staying out of trouble.
And, believe me, nobody represents more "trouble potential" than a customer who has sent in his
hard-earned money and feels it has disappeared down a rathole because no one ever bothered to
confirm or acknowledge his order.

#4. FILL ALL ORDERS AS FAST AS YOU CAN!

Both times I got in trouble with the post office, it was because of unfilled orders. Had the orders
been filled and filled promptly the ads and letters would most probably never been questioned.
Whether a certain statement in an ad or letter is deceptive is often subjective. However, there is
nothing subjective about an unfilled order.

You either did or you didn't and, if you didn't, you are begging for trouble.

#5. IMMEDIATELY GIVE A REFUND TO ANYONE WHO WANTS ONE!

Stop screwing around with this. If you say you'll give refunds, do it and do it promptly. If you
don't, one day you may end up with a problem that can no longer be solved even if you do finally
decide to make the refunds. The problem I'm talking about, of course, is the one where you
become a convicted felon.

#6. IMMEDIATELY ANSWER ALL YOUR WHITE MAIL!

"White mail" is any written correspondence from a customer that does not contain an order; like
requests for more info, requests for refunds, inquiries from BBBs and government agencies, etc.

Failure to communicate can lead to a loss of ability to communicate like, for example, when you're
locked up.

#7. DON'T RUB YOUR WEALTH IN OTHER PEOPLE'S FACES.

Showing off is one of the "perks" of being a success. However, I'd like to suggest you avoid trying
to impress people who are losers. Losers are bitter frustrated people who are constantly looking
for new people to blame for their failures. And, if their bitterness becomes too intense and their
focus settles on you, only trouble can result.

Go ahead and drive your Rolls to a meeting of the Young Millionaires Club but beware parking in
the K-Mart lot.

#8. DON'T TRUST YOUR LIFE TO YOUR LAWYER!

I don't care if he's your brother, your father or your spouse. It seems to me that almost all
lawyers are forced to have an "ethical bypass" operation as soon as they pass the bar. Question:
What show has the most ridiculous premise of all shows on network TV? Answer: L.A. LAW. L.A.


LAW always has a bunch of lawyers sitting around discussing lofty ethical considerations.

Are you kidding? That's not what lawyers sit around and gab about. No way. What they truly
concern themselves with is...

MILKING MONEY FROM MISERY!

But what's the alternative? Well, what I suggest is, that in addition to your lawyer, you get some
"reality oriented" advice from someone who has already suffered through whatever legal problems
you currently have. Believe me, you can get more sound advice from a few intelligent ex-cons
than all the lawyers in the world.

Hey, you want to know how you can tell when your lawyer is lying? That's easy. It's when his lips
are moving.

#9. KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY!

If you pump a little iron and run three or four miles a day, you'll unconsciously give off a different
class of vibes that signal you're not a vulnerable wounded fish and easy prey for all the two-
legged sharks of the world.

#10. KEEP YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR!

You think I've had it hard? Don't be silly. What I've endured is nothing compared to a kid born
with AIDS, a man who has lost his family in an air disaster or any of a jillion other things that
millions of people endure bravely every day of their lives.

Look, if history is any guide, none of us are gonna get out of this mess alive so we may as well
have a few laughs along the way.

Want to know when you finally realize it really has happened and you really are incarcerated? It's
when that big, ugly, muscle-bound guy across the hall informs you he thinks you're "cute."

Want to know when you know you've done too much time? It's when you're glad he thinks you're
cute!

Thank God I wasn't in long enough to get to the second stage but, I'll tell you, I learned what it
means to really miss your woman and I remembered why my nickname used to be "Goat Glands
Gary."

Enough. Someone once said that every man's life has value if for nothing else than to be used as
a bad example. Maybe that's me. You're a dumb bunny if you follow in my footsteps. Instead, let
me serve you another way. . .

LET ME BE YOURBAD EXAMPLE!


Sincerely,

Gary C. HalbertEx-Con

P.S. Are you one of those people who take chances because going to "Club Fed"
sounds like a vacation to you? Trust me, there are a few things about it you won't
like. For example, do you have a tendency to befoul the atmosphere and make funny
little noises when you use the bathroom?

How wonderful! Just think, when you go to Club Fed you can "share" those quaint
little personal eccentricities with dozens of other people everyday who will be going
to the bathroom with you! And gosh, you can also enjoy all their quaint little personal
bathroom habits.

Are you someone who values your privacy? Hmn? I wonder how you're going to like
it when some hack tells you to "bend over and spread em" so he can explore your
most private bodily cavity with his flashlight.

And don't think that, just because Club Fed is a camp, it only has white collar felons.
That's not the case. There are also bank robbers, drug dealers, blackmailers, contract
killers and many, plain old garden variety murderers.

Oh yeah, and there's one more bad thing about Club Fed.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE!

P.P.S. On the other hand, I think going to Club Fed was easily the most valuable
experience of my life. One of the reasons is that, in a perverse way, it set me free.
One day I was jogging and I suddenly realized I felt much lighter. Why? Because of
lack of guilt. You see, I figured that serving time for something of which I was not
morally guilty made me even. It made up for all those library books I never returned,
the teenage girls after whom I lusted and I was even able to forgive myself for all
those times I drove while drinking for which, in my opinion, I really deserved to go to
prison.

Sometimes life evens things up, doesn't it?

SECTION #16

How To Get The MostValuable Free Gift In All The World!

The section that you've just read was a hard one for me to write.

So hard, in fact, that I've been manufacturing excuses for more than a year to avoid working on
it. But anyway, now it's done and I'm glad it's over.

You know, I think sometimes, when you write about a difficult experience it has a cleansing effect
and it seems to "exorcise" some of the pain from your brain.

Whatever. In any case, as I said in my newsletter, going to Club Fed was not a totally negative
experience. For one thing, it gave me a chance to write my youngest son a series of 25 long
letters which contain, all in all, the most concise, hardest-hitting, no holds barred, direct
marketing education available anywhere on this planet. These letters contain 186 pages of
dynamite info!

But let me tell you this: These letters are raw. They pull no punches.

You know, when you are serving time, you don't feel much like pussy-footing around. Prison
conversations go right for the jugular. So do these letters! What I was trying to do here was to
give my son the fastest, most impactful education that can be transmitted by the written word.

I dare say I succeeded.

These letters contain a "stripped down" version of the most important secrets I've learned about
on how to sell by mail. They explain exactly how to develope a "killer" ad or direct mail package
right from the ground up. They teach you how to develop a "can't lose" marketing appeal. These
letters cover everything from postage to layout; offer development and list selection; how to
create a winning game plan and a lot more like this:


The basics of writing good copy.

The fine points of writing good copy.

What really makes people buy.

reader the moment he sees your copy.

The ultimate layout for an order coupon.

8 things you should have at hand before you start to write an ad or direct mail piece.

What you must always include in your marketing research.

How t manufacture the "aha!" experience.

That should be enough to give you the idea. There's an awful lot more. These letters read like
greased lightning. Sometimes, when I was writing them, it was 114 degrees outside and I would
be surrounded by every imaginable kind of felon. Coke dealers. Mafia hit men. Common
murderers. Motorcycle maniacs. Bank robbers. Embezzlers. And so on.

I didn't have time for chaff. These letters are all wheat. They contain the most intense personal
stuff I've ever written. It took me a while to make up my mind, but finally, I've decided to publish
and release them. They are collected in two attractive binders and I have titled them simply:


The Boron Letters

I have a bound set of these letters right here on my desk ready to send to you. I'll mail these out
(via first-class mail, of course) as soon as you give me the word. My offer is simple: What I'm
going to do is send a complete set of these letters absolutely free to every single person who is
reading this message and decides to purchase anything else whatsoever from my office within the
next 2 weeks. This means if you are not now a subscriber, you get the Boron Letters free for
coming aboard. If you are already a subscriber, you get the Boron Letters free for renewing you
subscription early or else purchasing the tapes of my 1-day seminar of any other of my
information packed products.

I hope you accept this offer. The Boron Letters are the most heartfelt messages I've ever written.
It would be impossible for anyone to lobe their children more than I love mine. And, in this case, I
was trying to give my youngest son the most precious gifts I have to offer: my love and my
expertise.

Anyway, if you are interested in this offer, please respond right away. Just call my office at (213)
273-7053 or else use the order form and reply envelope. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely

Gary Halbert

A Caring Father

P.S. These letters also contain a lot of wisdom on staying healthy and prospering in a mean world.
I don't know if you have a son or not, but, if you do, you could do a lot worse than giving him a
set of these letters.

Just one thing. These letters were written in a rather harsh environment. They contain a fair
amount of profanity. I guess that's indicative of where I was and how I was feeling when I wrote
them. If you want that (the profanity) deleted from your set of letters, please indicate and I'll
send you a slightly edited and "sanitized" version of all this material.

It's up to you.

YES, I am impressed with your offer and I would very much like to have a complete set of THE
BORON LETTERS. Therefore, I have decided to subscribe and I am enclosing $195.00 as a
payment in full for a 1-year subscription. Please send THE BORON LETTERS immediately via first-
class mail and don't bother to edit them in any way, shape or form. I understand that I have the
option of cancelling my subscription at any time for an immediate pro rata refund on all issues I
have not received and that I will stil be allowed to keep THE BORON LETTERS. On that basis, here
is my order.

NOTE: Check here if you want the edited ("sanitized") version of the letters which will have all
harsh language and profanity omitted.

P.S. I'd really appreciate a prompt reply to this offer. It took me a long time to make up my mind
to release this material and now I'm very anxious to see how it all works out. Thank you.
