<br><font color="#990000">I guess for you to fully understand this issue
of my newsletter, I'm going to have to reveal unto you a little-known secret
about myself. Some years ago in Los Angeles, I was rather thoroughly examined
by a psychiatrist and a team of psychologists. They discovered, just like
with everyone else, there are certain things a bit different about me which
set me apart from other people. Most of those differences are not all that
radical. But, they discovered one particular difference about me which
seemed to astonish them. What they concluded was ...</font>

To Money Than Anyone Else They Had Ever Examined!</font></b></center>

<p><font color="#990000">Don't get me wrong. I do think money is important.
However, I think about money the same way I think about oxygen. In other
words, I believe we all need oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but ... once you have
a sufficient amount of it... having more doesn't do much of anything to
actually enhance your life.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">The late Joe Karbo (one of the wisest men I've
ever met) once told me something I'll never forget. "Gary," he said, you
should continue to make money until you have no more problems that money
will solve. Truer words were never spoken, neither here nor in Hoboken
Well, as fascinating as I'm sure all this is to you, why am I telling you
about it? What the hell does it have to do with anythina? I beg thee Sire,
pray let me explain. I have been selling a report for $97.00 per copy entitled

<p><font color="#990000">The information in that report will not only slow
down and/or alleviate the aging process ... in many cases ... it will reverse
it. When Theresa (my Trusty Assistant for more than a decade) proofread
it with me, she got very angry ... and ... at one point ... I thought she
was going to cry.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">"What's wrong with you?" I asked. "This is one
of the best things I've ever written!"</font>
<br><font color="#990000">"Yes," she responded, "but ... it only pertains
to men. For men, it's incredible life-changing information. But, you've
never written anything at all like this of equal value for women!"</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Why haven't I? It's simply I don't know of any
information like this which would be of equal value for a woman.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">But, this got me to thinking: You know how, in
days of old, sailors would often get a deadly disease called "scurvy" when
they went on long voyages? Remember how it was discovered this was caused
by a lack of Vitamin C... and how ... the disease could be completely eradicated
if only the sailors would eat some fruit while on their long sea voyages?
And how the fruit of choice of British sailors was limes ... and how ...
that's how they came to be known as "Limeys"?</font>
<p><font color="#990000">OK, what if sailors were still dying from lack
of Vitamin C&nbsp; ... and ... vou were one of the very few ... who knew

<p>BEGIN REPORT

<br><b>Gary Halbert's Report On How To Slow Down, Stop</b>
<br><b>And Even Reverse The Aging Process</b>
<br><b>And Regain And Increase All The Youthful Energy,</b>

<p>Right off the bat, let's get one thing clear: I am not a doctor! What
that means is, taking medical advice from me would be a nutso thing for
you to do. Almost everyone who writes about anything to do with a medical
subject, always tells you to "check with your doctor before following this
or any other diet or health regimen." Is this good advice? In my opinion,
the answer is mostly no. Why then, does nearly everyone who writes about
health include a phrase about seeing your doctor first? The answer is easy:
They Want To Cover Their Butt!
<p>Here's what I believe: Before you follow the advice in this or any other
publication, you should see a doctor (a real M.D.)... but... that doctor
should not necessarily be your current doctor.
<p>Is that strange advice? Consider this true story... I've been using
the same doctor for years. (I'll refer to him as "Doctor Original".) He
knows and respects the fact I stay tuned in to a lot of medical research
... and ... for the most part, he almost automatically writes me any prescription
I request. Well, Dr. Original has become very successful and over the years
has built up his practice to, what I believe now is, 14 different offices.
As you can imagine, it's nearly impossible to get an appointment with him.
<p>Because even I couldn't get an appointment with him, Doctor Original
suggested I see an associate doctor who works with him. During my first
visit with this new doctor ("Doctor Replacement"), he refused to write
me a prescription for something I wanted. He explained, "I'm sorry. It's
just I'm very conservative. " "No, " I replied, "that's not true. In this
case, it's just you are ignorant of the facts. "
<p>Dr. Replacement discussed the situation with Dr. Original who then immediately
wrote me the prescription I wanted. I told Dr. Replacement where he could
do research on this particular item. On my next visit to Dr. Replacement,
when I asked for a renewal of that same prescription, he wrote it for me
with no hesitation at all. "Aha, " I said, "are you less 'conservative'
than you were on my last visit?" "No, " Dr. Replacement responded, "I just
did the research you asked me to do."
<p>That man is a good doctor. He doesn't have a closed mind. Many doctors
do. If you want to optimize your health, you must seek out a doctor with
an open mind. Not a reckless doctor; just one who will treat you as a peer
and check out any situations/research/options you might have.
<p>Here is an extremely important core truth: Its not their fault. As a
rule, doctors work themselves silly. Also, as a rule, they literally have
no time to keep abreast of what's new. As far as your health is concerned,
being kept abreast of what's new is your job! Medical Advances Are Being
Made So Fast Now .. There Is Not A Doctor In The World Who Can Keep Up
With Them!
<p>OK, let me lay upon you what many men are going to consider the most
important medical advance in history ... provided ... those men don't have
some life-threatening illness which has to be their primary concern.
<p>We are going to start, oddly enough, by talking about menopause. Menopause
starts when a woman stops having her menstruation. It hits her like a brick
wall. There is nothing gradual about it. She stops having periods, losses
much of her estrogen (the hormone which is responsible for most of her
feminine characteristics) and other hormones which are vital to her sense
of well being. She gets "hot flashes." She becomes moody and cranky. She
gets depressed. Sometimes, she thinks she is losing her mind. Her interest
in sex drastically declines and she doesn't lubricate as she used to. In
general, she becomes ...
<p>The physical effects of menopause I just described are horrible. As
if that's not enough, men have always (and still do) underate a woman's
misery who is undergoing these changes. Men tend to dismiss all this suffering
with an indulgent smile and a fatuous remark like, "Oh, she's just going
through the change. "
<p>'Just going through the change'? Let me tell you something: From a genetic,
biologically-imperative perspective, a woman's only job is to produce eggs
... and ... a man's only job is to fertilize those eggs. When a woman enters
menopause, she ceases to produce eggs and, from nature's point of view
.. A Truly Miserable Creature! So, nature seems to lose interest in the
woman's well-being and (this is just my opinion) There Is No Longer Any
Need For Her Continued Existence!
<br>... start sending that woman "misery signals." These "misery signals"
are nature's way of letting her know it might be time to consider the good
parts of her life are over .. and ... it would be no big loss if, right
about now, she would cease to exist. (Remember, this is nature's cruel
part of life. I would never treat a woman like that.)
<p>A woman going through menopause is not 'just going through the change'.
She is going through hell!
<p>no ... she is Miracle-of-miracles, along comes Estrogen Replacement
Therapy (ERT). Estrogen Replacement Therapy is just what it sounds like:
A doctor simply replaces the estrogen a woman is no longer able to produce
herself with estrogen produced from a lab. Perhaps ERT doesn't solve every
unpleasant side effect of menopause but, it beats most of them ... and
... in many (if not most) cases, ERT literally ... Gives A Menopausal Woman
Her Life Back!
<p>Men also go through something that, for lack of a better term, is often
referred to as "Male Menopause." This happens as a man's testosterone level
declines. Only with men, this doesn't happen in the blink-of-an-eye as
menopause seems to happen with women. So-called male menopause is a much
more gradual process. However, in what we now think of as mid-life, many
metes testosterone level has declined enough to cause him some real problems&nbsp;
... and ... the "main problem" men care about is ... those rock-hard ("diamond
cutter") erections. During this stage of a mares life, they just don't
happen like they used to.
<p>Ah, but not to worry because&nbsp; ... We Now Have Viagra! Viagra is
a great product. Pop one of those little blue pills ... and ... unless
you have a fairly serious health problem ... that little soldier of yours
is going to stand up and salute the flag just like he used to! But, it
only treats one specific symptom of a declining testosterone level. It
does nothing about the underlying real problem.
<p>Don't get me wrong: Viagra is truly a "wonder drug" which has dramatically
increased the happiness of millions of men. But, we can do much, much better!
Doesn't it seem obvious if estrogen dramatically enhances the life of a
menopausal woman&nbsp; ... giving testosterone to a man who is not a "young
Turk" any more will solve many of his problems?
<p>Well, doctors have been giving men testosterone shots for years and,
for the most part, the results haven't been all that great. Those shots
produce a lot of unpleasant side effects and medical concerns&nbsp; ...
and ... for most men, the rewards haven't seemed to be worth the risk.
This sucks, doesn't it? Menopausal women can mostly recapture the good
parts of their lives by taking estrogen (the female hormone) ... but ...
a man caift do the same by taking testosterone (the male hormone). What
a bummer!
<p>Except. It's Not True! As is often the case, what was wrong with TRT
(Testosterone Replacement Therapy) was so obvious, we couldn't see it.
What has been wrong with TRT in the past was ... how it was being administered!
Mainly, a man's replacement testosterone was being given to him all at
once by shooting him up with a needle. WHAM! A guy with low testosterone
gets a shot&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then ... all of a sudden ... his body is
flooded with the stuff.
<p>The results? He gets irritable. More combative. His sex drive does increase&nbsp;
... but ... only for a few days. Then, the testosterone starts rapidly
getting used up, and, a few days later, he changes from a raging bull (both
in and out of bed) to a weary pussycat.
<p>Listen up: A man's body is not equipped to handle a "sudden flood" of
testosterone. That's not the way his body ever naturally produced testosterone.
Testosterone, as it is produced naturally by the mate body, is secreted
almost constantly in much smaller amounts than you get when a doctor shoots
you up with a syringe full of the stuff. Lemme try to explain it this way-
You are aware (obviously) you have to eat a certain amount of calories
every month in order to function properly. Let's say, in your case, you
need about 2500 calories per day. Being the anal-retentive, efficiency
freak you are (I'm just kidding, you humorless twit) you decide to eat
the whole month's supply of calories (all 75,000 of them) ... In One Sitting!
Yes, you've gotten your entire month's caloric needs all taken care of..
in ONE meal. That would be about as crazy as getting an entire month's
supply of testosterone given to you all at once in a single injection.
<p>Here's the truth: For what is commonly referred to as male menopause,
testosterone replacement really is what's needed&nbsp;&nbsp; ... but ...
It's Got To Be "Time-Released" Testosterone!
<p>Guess what? Now you can get time-released testosterone. Here are the
different ways it is possible to receive replacement testosterone:
<p>&nbsp;- By Injection: By far ... the worst way to replace testosterone
... and ... unfortunately, the most common. Why? Remember the beginning
of this report I told you my true story about Doctor Replacement&nbsp;
... how he was ignorant of the newest medical research? Well, the answer
here is plain and simple ... the average doctor simply doesn't know any
better!
<p>&nbsp;- By Lozenges: Much better than injections ... but ... usually
you gotta swallow one of these suckers three times per day. Also, it will
take mucho hassle on your part to find (or educate) a doctor to prescribe
them for you. As if that's not enough, it's usually even more hassle to
find what's called a "compounding pharmacy" to make some of these lozenges
up for you.
<p>&nbsp;- By Testosterone Patches: Almost 100% side-effect free&nbsp;&nbsp;
... except ... for minor skin irritation. A popular patch is called "Androderm"
and almost any pharmacy has it. The patch provides a slow, steady release
of testosterone ... but ... it is possible, in some men it won't get your
testosterone level up to as high as it needs to be.
<p>&nbsp;- By A Gel: "Androgel" is quite a new product developed by Unimed
Pharmaceuticals located in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. It is a gel you smear
on your body (like your shoulder area) and it dries in just a few minutes.
You can then comfortably put on your T-shirt or shirt just like you normally
do. It comes in three different strengths: 50 mg, 75 mg, and I 00 mg. It
was approved by the FDA on February 28th of this (2000) year. What you
wanna bet this becomes one of the biggest-selling products in medical history?
Yahoo!
<p>I'm going to tell you about something I lay odds there isn't a single
doctor in the entire county where you live knows about. Check this out:
There is (to my knowledge) only one company which is an FDA approved maker
of.. A Testosterone Pellet! These are little gel-like objects implanted
by a doctor into the fat of one of your buttocks. Once implanted, the testosterone
gradually dissolves and gives your body that natural slow, steady ... constant
... infusion of testosterone. The embedding of the pellet is a pain-free
procedure and you only need to have another one implanted every four to
six months. This is, I believe, the "Rolls Royce" of delivery systems for
testosterone replacement.
<p>Now, read this:
<p>QUOTE:&nbsp; -------------------------------------------------------------
<p><i>"if I told you that one key substance in the body is more powerful
than any other health factor, is more closely linked to risk of illness
if and when a deficiency occurs, is more misunderstood, more improperly
used, and more tragically underused than any other, what would it be?</i>
<p><i>Testosterone!</i>
<p><i>I have studied it, prescribed it, and watched the responses of my
patients -- hundreds of them. I challenge anyone to find a more diversely
positive factor in men's health. When normally abundant, it is at the core
of energy, strength, stamina, and sexuality. When deficient, it is at the
core of disease and early demise.</i>
<p><i>Testosterone deficiency has been an unrecognized syndrome that impacts
every sinew and cell in the body. It is powerfully linked to nearly every
major degenerative disease. Use of this remarkable healing hormone could
reverse suffering and prevent early death. My research uncovered a mountain
of medical literature that has been basically ignored supporting its benefits.</i>
<p><i>I was taught that there was no male menopause and for years accepted
that as fact. A series of events in my own health and the discovery that
several pioneering physicians held entirely differing points of view changed
my mind and transformed my conception of age-related illness and preventive
medicine. Until that point, I had seen aging as an unrelenting natural
process that it was best to accept gracefully. Preventive medicine was
an attempt to treat or modify specific risk factors that, like a sleeping
lion, would jump up and bite you later in life.</i>
<p><i>My perspective changed dramatically. Clearly, preventive medicine
would widen in scope if it turned out aging was reversible. And, to a significant
extent, it is. The male menopause, a grim milestone in the middle passage
of a man's life, can be rolled back.</i>
<p><i>Testosterone decline is at the core of that male menopause (and a
key element in the female menopause as well). Naturally, the two sexes
have a different experience of midlife menopausal change. In women, there
is an explosion of in-your-face symptoms, while men's very similar symptoms
sneak in the back door unexpectedly like a thief in the night. Too often,
loss of energy, ambition, sexual drive, and a host of minor symptoms are
wriften off as 'burnout' or depression.</i>
<p><i>Women, meanwhile, have already learned that hormone replacement therapy
results in reversal of the physical changes of menopause. Men, confronted
by an information vacuum, still need to make the same discovery.</i>
<p><i>There are, of course, scientists on both sides of the fence. Even
after forty years of experience, few subjects engender more emotion and
controversy than estrogen replacement for women. Yet the vast majority
of studies show a risk-benefit ratio that emphatically favors the camp
of hormonal replacement. The considerable literature on testosterone replacement
shows a very similar balance of benefit over risk. Keep that in mind and
remember that quality of life is clearly the cornerstone of all treatment
decisions.</i>
<p><i>Why have the subject of male menopause and the advantages of testosterone
therapy taken so long to surface? One can only speculate. Perhaps the unspeakable
spectre of impotence is at the root of silence. Perhaps it simply takes
time for new ideas to rise into the medical mainstream. Old dogmas and
clinical habits die hard. It is well for us not to rashly assume that every
new nostrum has value, but resistance in the face of overwhelming science
has no excuse.</i>
<p><i>To prevent the suffering of many is, for me, a powerful motivator.
That is why I wrote this book.</i>
<p><i>Resistance will fade. Testosterone therapy has every prospect of
becoming for men what estrogen therapy is now for millions of women. The
male menopause, a real tragedy in the middle of the average man, has had

<p>You know what you just read? It is the "Preface" of a book you absolutely
MUST read! The book is called "The Testosterone Syndrome" and is subtitled,
"The Critical Factor For Energy, Health, &amp; Sexuality -- Reversing The
Male Menopause."
<p>This book was written by Eugene R. Shippen, M.D. and William Fryer.
It is published by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M. Evans and Company, Inc. located
at 216 East 49th Street, New York, NY 10017. The "locator number" (thats
what I call it) is ISBN: 0-87131-829-6. It will be very helpful if you
are trying to get it from a library or a bookstore. I got my copy from
Amazon.com.
<p>No matter what else you do in life ... Buy THIS Book! Here's a little
bit of what you have to gain: More strength! More energy! More zest for
life! "Diarnond-cutter" erections! Better memory! Better mental function!
Protection from heart problems! Boggs Less fatigue! A positive improvement
in mood! And so on. A slowing and even some reversal of aging!
<p>Onward. I'm sure you already know about the importance of exercise and
nutrition. One of my subscribers is a guy named Bill Phillips. I have mixed
emotions about him (matter of fact, I have mixed emotions about me) ...
but ... my emotions are not mixed at 0 about what he sells. Bill owns a
company named EAS in Golden, Colorado. He sells nutritional supplements.
<p>He also publishes the magazine, "Muscle Media 2000." Bill has, I believe,
put together .. The Best Health-improving System ... In The World!
<p>Call the toll-free number for EAS and tell them you want to get involved
in the " 12-Week Improvement" system they are promoting You're going to
get some GREAT info ... and ... I promise you, if you do what they advise
... your life will improve enormously! That's quite an endorsement from
me for a company owned by a guy I don't particularly like, isn't it?
<p>Look, I can't imagine myself enjoying going to supper with Bill Phillips
... but.. when it comes to nutrition and fitness ... He IS The Best! Call
his company and buy into their program. There's none better and the number
is.. 1-888-926-5524
<p>A final word:
<p>Would you like me to give you just one suggestion ... blindly ... will
improve your life more than anything else you can do? It's not difficult
to remember. It's not difficult to do. It doesn't require any special clothing.
that ... if you follow it It doesn't require any special equipment. Here
it is ...

<p><b>As Soon As You Wake Up In The Morning ...</b>
<br><b>Get Yourself Out Of Your House!</b></center>

<p>When you first open your eyes, note the time. You'll probably then want
to use the bathroom, brush your teeth and use a warm washcloth to scrub
the sleep out of your face. Dress. Put on a pair of walking shoes. Get
out the door. Look at your watch and note the time. Now&nbsp; .. Start
Walking After 15 minutes. Turn Around And Walk Back Home! That's it
<p>Do this eveky day. When you're home or when you're away from home.
<br>This is NOT your aerobic exercise. Don't worry about getting your heart
rate up.
<p>Have a contest with yourself to see how quickly you can get the regime
down.
<p>The part where get up, use the bathroom, brush your teeth, use a warrn
washcloth to scrub the sleep out of your face, dress including the walking
shoes and get out the door. Now, look at your watch and start walking.
This is the way ...
<p>You Should Start Your Day .. BEFORE&nbsp; ... You Start Your Day!
<p>Do it every day for seven weeks. This simple process will change your
whole physical and mental being for the better.
<p>I don't exactly know why ... but ... I Guarantee It To Be True!
<p>Arguably, the greatest discovery of this century was that of atomic
energy which could be expressed by Einstein's theory of relativity ...
which was simply ... E=mc<sup>2</sup>. How much are those simple letters
"E=mc<sup>2</sup>" worth? Although they only take up perhaps one inch of
space on one line of paper, those simple letters are worth untold trillions
of dollars.
<p>If you come across a safe which has ten million dollars locked inside
of it ... and ... you are told a simple 10-digit combination is necessary
to open that safe ... how valuable to you are those simple ten digits?
<p>The point I'm making is, there are many people who judge the worth or
the value of information by the volume or the weight of how that information
was delivered to them. Many people think a 300-page hard cover book filled
with nothing but gibberish is worth many times more than a 50-page paperback
filled with hard-hitting data and advice; data and advice so valuable,
it literally changes their lives.
<p>This report of mine, "How To Slow Down, Stop And Even Reverse The Aging
Process And Regain And Increase All The Youthful Energy, Vitality And Sexual
Passion You Once Enjoyed!" does not contain many pages. Nor is this report
of mine fancied up with a binder or a hard cover. Matter of fact, if you
would put this report on a scale, it wouldn't even measure up to half-a-pound.
<p>But... on the other hand... I want you to know I have just given you
the core facts pertaining to recapturing and maintaining your health which
took me several years of research to discover. If you're one of those people
who gives worth and value to information by its volume and weight, you're
probably disappointed with this report.
<p>However, if you're one of those people who gives worth and value to
information by its enlightenment and knowledge, you're astounded with the
contents of this report. You're probably someone (like most of my subscribers)
who can appreciate a multi-million dollar idea capable of changing your
life found scribbled on a napkin or written on the back of an envelope.
<p>The "presentation" of the information doesn't matter.. the information
itself is what's vital. I could have written 200 pages more in this report
but, it was pointless. Stripped down of all the mumbo-jumbo, you've got
it now. You've got the secret. You now have information which isn't even
possessed by one out of a thousand doctors. It is my heartfelt hope you
understand and use this discovery to recapture your youth, health, sexual
vigor and vitality.
<p>Perhaps someday we can meet in person at one of my seminars and maybe
have some fun laughing at the stories we can share of how others didn't
believe our true ages when we told them. (I can't count the number of times
I've had to show my driver's license to men and women alike to verify my
true age.)
<p>Thank you for ordering this report. It seems to me, these days, I am
walking amongst a world of braindead zombies&nbsp; ... and ... its harder
than ever for me to find people like you who at least have a pulse and
an inquiring mind. Go get'em Tiger! Go slow down the aging process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
... and ... regain and increase all the youthful energy, vitality and sexual
passion you once enjoyed!
<p>Peace.

<p><font color="#990000">There you have it. That is the report I have been
sending to the people who have paid me $97.00 each to receive it. However,
the version with which I have been filling orders has a larger type font
and wider margins and, thus is a bit easier to read than the above compressed
version. Theresa re-created the report to fit within the confines of this
newsletter.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">How valuable is this info? If you are in My age
group (I qualified for Social Security on my last birthday) the info you
just read can literally give you your youth back.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">You know the product "Androgel" you just read
about in the report? As I said, "Androgel" was approved by the FDA on February
28th of this year and it didn't go on sale until June 14th. By my getting
in touch with Unimed Pharmaceuticals and getting all their info... and...
by printing out info on "Androderm" (a different product) I got by doing
Internet research... I Was Able To Educate My Doctor And My Pharmacist
About This Hot, New Product! Because of that, I may very well be the first
person in the entire State of Florida (or maybe even in the entire United
States) to get a prescription for this product ... and ... get that prescription
filled ... and ... I applied it to myself this very morning for the first
time.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">It's INCREDIBLE! It gives you complete control
of the dosage. It's odorless and causes no skin irritation whatsoever.
It's invisible, it doesn't fall off like an "Androderm" patch and it's
100% undetectable. Wait, there's more! Are you already selling something&nbsp;
... that ... if you gave away MY report as a bonus premium ... it would
enhance your sales? If so, you have my permission - to reprint my r@qport
and use it in that fashion ... with ... no compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whatsoever!</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Are you looking for a product of value to sell?
If so, I hereby give you my permission to reprint MY report and sell it
to your heart's content ... with ... no compensation to me whatsoever!
Would you just like to be able to Xerox copies of MY report and give it
to a certain group of your friends you care about? If so, you have my permission
to do so ... <u>with ... no compensation to me whatsoever!</u> the while,
you are learning from this issue of my newsletter.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">You are learning a marketing lesson. Listen up:
I've been selling a 20-page report for nearly $5.00 per page and nobody
has asked for a refund.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Why? Because I have delivered information of absolutely
vital importance in an informative and entertaining manner. What I gave
people in this report is the "key-to-the-safe." When you really do deliver
the "key-to-the-safe," nobody cares if you deliver it on one piece of paper
or 10,000.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Actually, that's not true. Unless the person is
a Mongolian Idiot, held rather have the info on just one sheet as opposed
to 10,000.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Think about it. These days, who the hell has time
for 999 pages of unnecessary reading?</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Don't bitch and moan ever again about not having
a product to sell. For openers, you've got this one. Furthermore, there's
nothing in the world that stops you from creating an almost endless number
of other valuable reports like this. It does take research, work, energy
and time ... but ... it's worth the effort.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">You can charge $100.00 or more for the product.
Print and mail it for about a buck (that's a 100% mark-up) and... Wins!</font>
<p><font color="#990000">Sincerely,</font>
<br><font color="#990000">Gary Halbert</font>
<br><font color="#990000">"The Erection Connection"</font>
<p><font color="#990000">P.S. Have you called 305/534-7577 and left a message
telling Theresa you want more info on my "No Agenda Seminar"?</font>
<br><font color="#990000">If not, you're going to be very, very sorry.
You see, that seminar is going to deliver info ... about making money ...
that is as valuable and little-known as the health info in this newsletter.</font>
<p><font color="#990000">P. S. #2 Don't forget grout sponge. Peace</font>
